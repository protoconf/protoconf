// hooks/gsd-cursor-subagent-start.js).
//
// #3045 BLOCKER: the guards previously keyed enforcement on the capability
// REGISTRY's `dispatch.isolation` ("this host CAN isolate"), not the
// workflow's resolved per-dispatch ISOLATION ("this dispatch SHOULD be
// isolated"). Sequential ISOLATION=none legitimately happens on a
// harness-worktree-capable host — project-level `workflow.use_worktrees:
// false`, the #2474 per-plan submodule degrade, and the #683/#3060
// base-check auto-degrade all resolve to `none` and are NOT bugs
// (gsd-core/workflows/execute-phase/steps/executor-isolation-dispatch.md:
// "Sequential mode … Omit isolation=\"worktree\" from the Agent call").
//
// The workflow already computes ISOLATION deterministically in shell before
// any executor dispatch. CORE REDESIGN (two-review follow-up): the PRIMARY
// write path is now `dispatch-isolation` itself (gsd-tools.cjs
// routeDispatchIsolation) — it persists mode + harnessFlag + phase/plan
// identifiers to the sentinel as an unconditional side effect of resolving
// them, since the workflow must call it to learn ISOLATION at all.
// `record-dispatch-isolation` (routeRecordDispatchIsolation) remains as an
// explicit fallback for the per-plan submodule-degrade override and shares
// the exact same atomic-write implementation.
//
// Sentinel path: `<cwd>/.gsd/dispatch-isolation-sentinel.json`. `.gsd` is
// gitignored (root `.gitignore`'s bare `.gsd` entry matches at any depth),
// and lives inside the checkout that ran the workflow — concurrent worktrees
// of the same repo are separate directories on disk, so each gets its own
// sentinel with no cross-worktree collision, no lock file needed.
//
// #3045 SECURITY F3 (LOW, accepted risk — documented, not redesigned for):
// the sentinel lives at a fixed, predictable, gitignored path inside the
// PRIMARY checkout. An agent already running inside a legitimately isolated
// worktree (i.e. one that has shell/filesystem access to the primary
// checkout's absolute path, which every worktree-isolated agent does by
// construction) could write a fabricated fresh `{isolation:"none"}` sentinel
// into the primary checkout to silence this guard for that checkout's next
// dispatch.
//   - This grants NO NEW write privilege: that same agent could already edit
//     any file in the primary checkout directly (worktree isolation protects
//     the primary checkout from an UNTRUSTED executor's own dispatch, not
//     from a trusted orchestrator process choosing to reach across).
//   - It DOES add an evasion path: silencing the guard via the sentinel
//     leaves no trace in `git status` (`.gsd/` is gitignored), where a direct
//     edit to a tracked file would.
// Accepted because the threat model this guard defends against is an
// UNCONSENTED, UNVERIFIED dispatch — not a deliberately adversarial
// orchestrator process, which already has strictly more direct means to
// cause harm than forging this one file. If that threat model changes (e.g.
// executors become mutually distrusting / sandboxed from the orchestrator's
// own filesystem), the hardening path is a SESSION-KEYED sentinel written
// outside any worktree the executor can reach (e.g. under the harness's own
// config dir, keyed by a session/run id neither the executor nor a forged
// file can predict) rather than a path derivable from `cwd`.

//
// Previously 4h, on the theory that a slow multi-wave phase execution could
// span well over an hour. That reasoning no longer holds: the #3045 CORE
// REDESIGN makes `dispatch-isolation` (gsd-tools.cjs routeDispatchIsolation)
// the sole write path, called as a side effect of resolving ISOLATION — and
// the workflow now re-resolves (and therefore re-records) immediately before
// EVERY plan's dispatch, at the per-plan worktree gate
// (execute-phase/steps/per-plan-worktree-gate.md), not once per phase. A long
// trust window no longer buys the workflow anything and only widens the
// window in which a stale sentinel from an EARLIER, DIFFERENT phase/plan
// (e.g. one that legitimately degraded to `none`) could be misread as
// authorizing a LATER dispatch that never got its own fresh record (a model
// skipping the kwarg on a harness-worktree phase while a same-session
// same-project stale `none` from a prior phase is still "fresh" by the old
// 4h window).
//
// 10 minutes generously covers the real latency between a per-plan gate's
// resolve call and that same plan's `Agent()`/`Task()` dispatch (worktree
// creation, orphan-worktree sweep, base-check, prompt composition) — all

// timeouts — while being far too short for a sentinel to survive into a

/**
 * Resolve the project root a sentinel should be read from/written to, using

 * before invoking a route handler: `findProjectRoot(resolveMainWorktreeCwd(cwd))`
 * (gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs main(), :3506/:3603 — `record-dispatch-isolation`
 * and `dispatch-isolation` are not in SKIP_ROOT_RESOLUTION, so every write
 * goes through both steps).
 *
 * #3045 MINOR fix: the guard hooks previously read the sentinel from the raw
 * `data.cwd` / `workspace_roots[i]` the harness reports, with NO equivalent
 * resolution. For a linked worktree that does not itself own a `.planning/`
 * (the common shape — `.planning/` lives in the main worktree only), the
 * writer resolves up to the MAIN worktree and writes there, while the reader
 * checked `.planning/config.json` at the raw (unresolved) linked-worktree
 * path, found nothing, and silently treated the dispatch as "not a GSD
 * project" (inert allow) — the guard was reading a sentinel that was never
 * written where it looked. Deriving both sides through this one function
 * closes that divergence.
 *
 * `findProjectRoot`/`resolveWorktreeRoot` are read from the sibling
 * `gsd-core/bin/lib/*.cjs` modules staged alongside these hooks at install
 * time (same pattern the guard hooks already use for
 * capability-registry.cjs/runtime-name-policy.cjs) — two directories up from
 * `hooks/lib/` (`hooks/lib/isolation-sentinel.js` -> `hooks/` -> repo/install
 * root -> `gsd-core/bin/lib/`), mirroring the one-directory-up requires the
 * top-level `hooks/*.js` guard scripts already use successfully.
 *
 * Never throws; any resolution failure (module missing, git unavailable,
 * git timeout) degrades to the raw `cwd` unchanged — the caller's existing
 * "sentinel absent -> conservative fallback" path already covers that safely.
