// GSD Agent Isolation Dispatch Guard — PreToolUse hook (#3045)
//
// Problem: `gsd-core/workflows/execute-phase/steps/executor-isolation-dispatch.md`
// resolves the project's dispatch isolation correctly
// (`gsd_run query dispatch-isolation --raw`), but DELIVERY of that value into
// the model-authored `Agent(subagent_type="gsd-executor", ...)` call is a
// prose instruction ("substitute $HARNESS_FLAG's value ... on Claude Code it
// is literally isolation=\"worktree\""). Nothing verifies the model actually
// copied it. When it is omitted, the executor runs and commits directly in
// the user's PRIMARY checkout instead of an isolated worktree, with no
// consent and no warning.
//
// A prose backstop cannot fix a prose defect — it is the same class of
// artifact the model may equally skip. This hook enforces the invariant at
// the tooling layer instead: HARD-BLOCKING.
//
// Applicability (must positively determine all three to act — otherwise
// inert):
//   1. this is a GSD project (`.planning/config.json` exists under cwd),
//   2. the project's resolved dispatch isolation is `harness-worktree`,
//   3. the dispatch target is an executor (`subagent_type === "gsd-executor"`;
//      no other executor-shaped subagent type exists in agents/ today).
//
// Fail-closed exception (#3050 lesson: a guard that cannot verify must not
// answer "safe"): if the project IS a GSD project but the hook cannot read
// or resolve its dispatch-isolation configuration, it DENIES rather than
// defaulting to the "safe-looking" none/allow value that
// `gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`'s own `routeDispatchIsolation` degrades to on
// error. That existing query is fail-OPEN by design (sequential execution
// is always safe for the SCHEDULER); this guard's job is the opposite
// invariant (never dispatch unisolated when isolation was promised), so it
// cannot reuse that fail-open default and instead resolves isolation
// itself, distinguishing "resolved cleanly" from "could not resolve".
//
// Isolation resolution (#3045 BLOCKER fix, see hooks/lib/isolation-sentinel.js):
// prefers the workflow's own PERSISTED per-dispatch decision (a sentinel
// `record-dispatch-isolation` writes after `executor-isolation-dispatch.md`
// resolves ISOLATION in shell, applying workflow.use_worktrees, the #2474
// per-plan submodule degrade, and the #683/#3060 base-check auto-degrade)
// over re-deriving a host CAPABILITY from the registry. A fresh sentinel is
// authoritative — `none`/`orchestrator-worktree` ALLOW immediately
// (sequential/orchestrator-managed dispatch is legitimate, not a bug); an
// absent/stale sentinel falls back to a conservative registry+config check
// (GSD_RUNTIME env > .planning/config.json `runtime` > the per-install
// `.gsd-runtime` marker, #3566 — no confident signal degrades to inert rather
// than guessing 'claude', see resolveRegistryIsolation)
// gated additionally by `workflow.use_worktrees` — read directly, in-process,
// no subprocess spawn.
//
// Triggers on: Agent/Task tool calls with subagent_type === "gsd-executor"
//   (both names accepted — #3045 MAJOR 1: only Agent was previously matched,
//   silently inert on any host/version whose subagent tool is named Task).
// Action: BLOCK (exit 2) when isolation should be enforced and is not
// No-op: any tool other than Agent/Task, non-executor targets, GSD projects
//        whose resolved isolation is not harness-worktree, non-GSD projects,
//        malformed payloads, or a dispatch that already carries the correct
//        isolation parameter.

/**
 * Resolve this project's declared `runtime` identity WITHOUT defaulting to
 * 'claude' when no explicit signal exists (#3045 MAJOR 2).
 *
 * `gsd-core/templates/config.json` — the actual scaffold used to write every
 * new project's config.json — ships with NO `runtime` key, so "no signal"
 * is the COMMON case, not a corner case. Previously this resolution silently
 * defaulted to 'claude' in that case, which meant every non-Claude runtime
 * that also installs this hook (any `hostIntegration.hooksSurface ===
 * 'settings-json'` runtime, not only Claude) had Claude's
 * `harnessIsolationFlag` ("isolation=\"worktree\"") demanded on its Agent()
 * -equivalent dispatch — a kwarg that runtime's own tool never accepts.
 *
 * Returns `{ runtimeId, confident }`. `confident` is true only when an
 * explicit signal exists (GSD_RUNTIME env override, a `runtime` key literally
 * present in config.json, the per-install `.gsd-runtime` marker, or a
 * `runtime` persisted to `~/.gsd/defaults.json` by the installer — see
 * below); false means "cannot determine" and callers must NOT silently
 * substitute 'claude' — see resolveRegistryIsolation.
 *
 * #3045 BLOCKER 2 fix: precedence is GSD_RUNTIME env > config.json `runtime`
 * key > `~/.gsd/defaults.json` `runtime`. The first two are unchanged; the
 * third is NEW — `bin/install.js`'s `writeNonClaudeDefaults` already persists
 * the installed runtime to `~/.gsd/defaults.json` for every non-Claude
 * runtime install (`defaults.runtime = runtime`, #2395), so this is real,
 * already-shipping data, not a new write. Before this fix, "no signal" was
 * the COMMON case for any project whose config.json was scaffolded from
 * `gsd-core/templates/config.json` (which ships with NO `runtime` key) and
 * whose session had no `GSD_RUNTIME` override — i.e. nearly every non-Claude
 * install, since Claude installs never reach `writeNonClaudeDefaults` at all
 * (`nativeModelAliases` short-circuits it) and therefore correctly still rely
 * on config.json/env. Reading the installer's own persisted signal makes
 * "confident" the common case instead.
 *
 * #3566: the per-install `.gsd-runtime` marker now sits BETWEEN config.json
 * and defaults.json. defaults.json is host-wide and names whichever runtime
 * installed LAST — on a 2-runtime machine that confidently resolves the WRONG
 * runtime (a Codex install's `runtime:"codex"` leaking into Claude projects),
 * and when the wrong runtime declares no harnessIsolationFlag the guard goes
 * silently inert. The marker describes THIS install (written for every
 * runtime since #2297), which is the source #2840's config.cjs change names
 * as correct. defaults.json stays as the final rung so single-runtime default
 * installs and pre-#2297 installs (no marker on disk) keep the #3045
 * BLOCKER 2 behavior.
