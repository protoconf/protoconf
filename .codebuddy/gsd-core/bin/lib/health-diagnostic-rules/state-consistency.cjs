/**
 * Health Diagnostic Rules — STATE.md consistency group (Phase 11, #3309,
 * ADR-3180 §8.2/§8.3/§8.5).
 *
 * Five rules, each a near-mechanical extraction of an already-working
 * `addIssue` call site in `cmdValidateHealth` (Gall's Law, design doc "Rule
 * table organization" / "Laws applied"):
 *
 *  - W024 (`verify.cts:1709-1729`) — STATE.md `state_head` commit-age
 *    freshness vs. git HEAD. GENUINE GAP, deliberately NOT migrated — see the
 *    `RULE_W024` comment below for exactly why.
 *  - W002 (`verify.cts:1731-1774`) — STATE.md references a phase token not
 *    declared anywhere (disk or ROADMAP).
 *  - W011 (`verify.cts:2104-2134`) — STATE's current-phase status disagrees
 *    with ROADMAP's `[x]` checkbox for that same phase.
 *  - W021 (`verify.cts:2270-2299`, the FIRST `addIssue('warning', 'W021', ...)`
 *    call site) — under the `'milestone-prefixed'` `phase_id_convention`, a
 *    phase's integer prefix implies a different milestone than the ROADMAP
 *    section it is actually listed under.
 *  - W026 (`verify.cts:2356-2399`, the SECOND `addIssue('warning', 'W021', ...)`
 *    call site — split off per the design doc's "New codes for the two split
 *    subjects" section, since one code covering two unrelated subjects is a
 *    genuine conflation) — STATE says the milestone is complete/archived, but
 *    ROADMAP (scoped to that same milestone) still lists a phase with no
 *    matching disk directory.
 *
 * - W002's original message interpolates `${slash('health')}`
 *   (`verify.cts:1770`) and W011's interpolates `${slash('progress')}`
 *   (`verify.cts:2126`) — both per-project runtime-resolved values
 *   (`formatGsdSlash`, `src/runtime-slash.cts`) this rule's
 *   `(snapshot) => Diagnostic[]` signature has no access to. Hardcodes the
 *   canonical `/gsd-health`/`/gsd-progress` hyphen form instead, mirroring
 *   the sibling "config.json validation" group's W016 rule
 *   (`src/health-diagnostic-rules/config-validation.cts`), which hardcodes
 *   `/gsd-ai-integration-phase` the same way for the identical reason.
 *

/**
 * W024's real check (`verify.cts:1709-1729`) calls
 * `readStateHeadFreshness(cwd, fm['state_head'])`, which shells out to `git
 * log` to count commits between the frontmatter's `state_head` and the
 * current HEAD. That is ambient I/O (git history), not `.planning/` content —
 * confirmed against `src/planning-snapshot.cts`'s full 15-field
 * `PlanningSnapshot` interface: no field wraps `readStateHeadFreshness` or
 * exposes a commits-behind count.
 *
 * §8.1 rule 1 requires a rule's signature to be `(snapshot) => Diagnostic[]`
 * with no ambient I/O inside `check` — so this rule does NOT call
 * `readStateHeadFreshness` itself (that would violate the constraint the
 * skeleton's own `Rule.check` type exists to enforce). Adding a 16th
 * `PlanningSnapshot` field (e.g. `stateHeadFreshness: {value:
 * {commitsBehind, stateHead}, scope}`) is the fix, but is out of this
 * group's scope (`src/planning-snapshot.cts` is a shared file this task was
 * not dispatched to extend).
 *
 * Registered here, `check` always returning `[]`, so the code table stays
 * complete per §8.2's 1:1 invariant (every code the old `verify.cts` emitted
 * has exactly one `Rule` entry) rather than silently dropping W024 from the
 * table. This is a documented, deliberate deferral pending the 16th snapshot
 * field — flagged prominently rather than quietly ported as a no-op.

 * `forEachArchivedPhaseToken` (archived milestone-phase-dir tokens,

 * way `collectDiskPhaseEntries` does — via `extractPhaseToken`) and
 * `roadmapDeclaredPhases.value.map(p => p.phaseId)` (ROADMAP-declared phase
 * ids). Archived-phase-token coverage is NOT included — no
 * `PlanningSnapshot` field exposes archived milestone-phase-dir tokens
 * (confirmed against the 15-field interface). Omitting it makes this valid
 * set a SUBSET of the original's, which can only make MORE STATE.md phase
 * tokens look "invalid" (never fewer) — a conservative, safe direction; a
 * project with archived phases still referenced from STATE.md is the
 * fixture shape that would expose a false positive, and none of this
 * group's fixtures exercise archives, so this gap is disclosed rather than
 * silently absorbed.
 *
 * UPDATE (#3652): archived-phase-token coverage IS now included, via the
 * additive `snapshot.archivedPhaseTokens` field
 * (`src/planning-snapshot.cts`, added for this fix) — the disclosed gap
 * above is closed; the paragraph is kept for the "conservative direction"
 * reasoning, which still explains why every OTHER omission in this
