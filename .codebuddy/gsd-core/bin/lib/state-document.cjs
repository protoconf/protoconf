 * Single owner of the #1760 STATE.md field-extraction fallback chain: "read

 * independent re-derivations of this chain — `src/smart-entry.cts`'s
 * `fmScalar` closure, and `src/state.cts`'s `cmdStateSnapshot` and
 * `cmdStatePrune` — onto one function, per ADR-3180 Decision 1 ("keep N
 * copies with a parity test" is rejected: a parity test proves today's
 * agreement, not that copy N+1 won't happen).
 *
 * Takes ALREADY-PARSED `fm` and `body` rather than raw STATE.md content: the
 * heaviest caller, `cmdStateSnapshot`, reads roughly ten fields off one parse
 * and must not re-parse frontmatter per field.
 *
 * `stateExtractField` (above) is deliberately left untouched — it has 20
 * direct callers and a CRITICAL blast radius (ADR-3180 §7.7's Rejected #1) —
 * so this function is additive: it calls `stateExtractField` rather than
 * replacing it or changing its signature.
 *
 * Fallback ladder (unchanged from every prior copy this replaces):
 *   1. `fm[fmKey]` is a non-empty (post-`.trim()`) string → that trimmed
 *      string.
 *   2. `fm[fmKey]` is a `number` or `boolean` → `String(fm[fmKey])`, so `0`
 *      and `false` are VALUES, not absence.
 *   3. Anything else (`null`, `undefined`, an object, an array, or an
 *      empty/whitespace-only string) → fall through to
 *      `stateExtractField(body, bodyField)`.
 *
 * `fmKey === null` skips steps 1–2 outright: for a caller whose chain has no
 * frontmatter side for this particular field (e.g. `state.cts`'s body-only
 * `Last Activity` / `Last activity` case-variant pair, which sits inside a
 * function that DOES own a ladder for its other fields, so per this phase's
 * function-scoped guard it must still route through this owner).
 * `bodyField === null` skips step 3: for a caller whose "no frontmatter
 * value" case falls through to an already-computed value instead of a fresh
 * extractor call (e.g. `cmdStateSnapshot`'s `last_activity`, which falls to
 * its already-parsed prose date rather than re-extracting the body).
 *
 * `scope` reports whether the chain ran over inputs it could actually
 * consult (ADR-3180 Decision 2/§7.7 — mirrors `scanPhasePlans`'s
 * scope-carrying result in `plan-scan.cts`; see `planning-scope.cjs`). This
 * function's own ladder always runs to completion on whatever `fm`/`body` it
 * is given, INCLUDING when the answer is `null` — a genuinely absent field is
 * a real answer, not a failure to look (§7.7 behavior table row 4). So
 * `scope` defaults to `SCOPE.COMPLETE` and is only ever something else when
 * the CALLER passes `opts.scope`, because only the caller knows whether an
 * input it handed in was itself degraded — e.g. `fm` came back `{}` from an
 * unterminated frontmatter fence (`extractFrontmatter` swallows that parse
 * failure), or `body` is an unscoped whole-document fallback because a

 * Match the "Current Position" section body from a STATE.md body. #2956: this

 * lives under `## Current Position` (gsd-core/templates/state.md), so — like
 * Stopped At / Paused At under `## Session` — it must be extracted from THAT
 * section, not from the first `Phase:` / `**Phase:**` line anywhere in the
 * body. Without the scope, a historical `Phase:` line in an archive section
 * silently shadows the real one on every read/write, and because callers use
 * this for routing (state.cts's current_phase) and for drift detection
 * (gsd-tools.cjs's `drift-guard phase-status` CLI seam), a stale match either
 * routes work to the wrong phase or fabricates a drift finding.
 *
 * Level-flexible: the canonical template uses an h2 `## Current Position`, the
 * bootstrap template an h3 `### Current Position` (templates/state.md). Both
 * must match — mirroring how matchSessionSection recognises `## Session` and
 * `## Session Continuity`. Exact 'current position' text match (case-
 * insensitive) excludes unrelated headings. Built on the `collectSection`
 * seam, so it inherits that seam's CRLF tolerance (#2444 fix).
 *
 * This is the single owner of the scope — state.cts's private
 * `matchCurrentPositionSection` delegates here rather than duplicating the
 * logic, so the two consumers cannot drift apart.
