/**
 * Plan Dependency Graph — shared halt-propagation over a plan's depends_on DAG (#2830).
 *
 * Two independent "which plans are incomplete" readers exist in this codebase:
 * phase.cts's wave-grouping (`cmdPhasePlanIndex`) and phase-locator.cts's
 * phase-location primitive (`searchPhaseInDir`, consumed by ~50 symbols across
 * five command routers). Before #2830, only the former parsed `depends_on` —
 * and even it used the DAG only for topological wave assignment, never to
 * propagate a halted plan's block onto its dependents. The latter never parsed
 * `depends_on` at all; it derived completion from summary-file presence only.
 * A plan that reaches a designed stop still writes a SUMMARY (recording the
 * halt in prose only — no prior structured status existed for it), so both
 * readers saw it as ordinary "complete" and reported its dependents as
 * ordinary incomplete work, available to spawn against.
 *
 * This module is the SINGLE topological-order + halt-propagation engine both
 * readers call, so the two can never re-diverge on this rule again. Each
 * caller resolves its own raw `depends_on` tokens to canonical plan ids
 * (case-fold + `extractCanonicalPlanId` fallback — the same resolution
 * already performed by phase.cts's `computeDependencyLevels`) before
 * building `PlanHaltNode[]`; this module owns the graph traversal (exactly
 * one pass — Kahn's algorithm, or none at all when the caller already has a
 * valid topological order, see `computeHaltPropagation`'s `precomputedOrder`
 * parameter) plus the two small pure helpers below (`isHaltedStatus`,
 * `buildSummaryFileIndex`) that both callers would otherwise duplicate
 * identically — the exact "two implementations, one drifts" failure mode
 * this fix exists to close. Each caller still owns its own file I/O (the
 * actual `fs.readFileSync` + `extractFrontmatter` calls); only the
 * interpretive logic is centralized here — except the SUMMARY-file
 * read+extract wrapper itself (`isSummaryFileHalted`), which both callers
 * previously duplicated near-identically and which is now centralized here
 * too, for the same reason.
