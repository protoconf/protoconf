// + shell-command-projection.cjs) are tsc build artifacts (ADR-457),
// gitignored and absent on a raw plugin-marketplace / git-clone install that
// never ran `npm run build:lib`. This worker is a DETACHED SessionStart
// background process (spawned with stdio: 'ignore') — a build failure here
// must DEGRADE to the no-signal fallbacks below (mirroring the
// managed-hooks-registry.cjs degrade just below) so the worker still runs to
// completion and writes a result cache record, rather than dying silently
// with no visible signal and no cache-file write at all.
//
// This try/require/ensureRuntimeBuild/require/catch shape repeats (with
// different destructured names) in hooks/gsd-check-update.js and
// hooks/gsd-update-banner.js. It is deliberately NOT extracted into a shared
// hooks/lib/ helper: scripts/lint-hooks-runtime-build-seam.cjs enforces this
// exact seam textually, PER FILE — it greps each hooks/ file for its OWN
// literal `require('.../ensure-runtime-build.cjs')` + `ensureRuntimeBuild(`
// call co-occurring with its OWN literal `require('.../gsd-core/bin/lib/*.cjs')`.
// A generic helper taking the compiled module's path as a variable would move
// the literal compiled-lib require OUT of this file and into the helper,
// called with a non-literal argument — the scan's regex (see that script's
// "Known limitations") cannot see a require() called with a variable, so this
// file would then read as "requires nothing" and the lint would stop
// protecting it. A ceremony-only helper (just the ensureRuntimeBuild call,
// each caller keeping its own literal compiled-lib require) fails the SAME
// way from the other side: it would remove this file's own literal
// `require('.../ensure-runtime-build.cjs')` + `ensureRuntimeBuild(` call,
// which the lint also requires to be textually present in THIS file. Either
// shape needs the lint script itself widened to special-case the helper,
// which is a bigger, riskier change than the ~6 duplicated lines it would
// save; kept inline instead.
