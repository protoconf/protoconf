 * #612: resolve `phase_id_convention` with the SAME workstream->root federation
 * config-loader uses (config-loader.cts:618/:649) — the workstream config wins,
 * the root config is the fallback.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than `loadConfig(cwd)['phase_id_convention']`: as of
 * #2997 (aa7697fe, in `next`), loadConfig surfaces `phase_id_convention` in
 * its resolved `_baseConfig` — the "loadConfig drops keys it does not know"
 * rationale this comment used to give is stale. The surviving reasons for the
 * direct read are (1) the workstream->root federation below, a standalone
 * resolution this function needs to run against a GIVEN cwd rather than
 * whatever base a `loadConfig(cwd)` call elsewhere would federate from, and
 * (2) convention-ENUM validation, which is still #612 PR-4 work — this
 * function returns the raw string unvalidated, same as the now-surfaced
 * resolved key would. #2997 surfacing the key makes consuming it from
 * resolved config (instead of re-reading config.json here) a natural PR-4
 * consolidation, not this PR's scope. Cycles were never the obstacle.
 *
 * Why federation matters here specifically: the phase-id readers were splitting
 * on this value from two different bases — one resolving from the workstream
 * directory, one from the root — so a workstream repo got the widened ROADMAP
 * read with the narrow directory read, or the reverse, and reported every phase
 * either missing from disk or malformed on disk. One resolver, one answer.
 *
 * The workstream is `planningDir`'s own `ws` parameter, forwarded, so this
 * shares the canonical resolution (and its GSD_PROJECT/GSD_WORKSTREAM
 * handling). Root is consulted as a fallback only when a workstream is active,
 * matching config-loader; a project-scoped directory stands alone. Returns null
 * when unset, absent, or unreadable — every caller treats null as "not the
 * bracket convention".
 *
 * #2761 B1 (trek-e review): `ws` is a PARAMETER, not read from the environment
 * here. It was omitted at first on the reasoning that "the active workstream is
 * whatever planningDir resolves" — true only for the env-driven caller. A
 * caller that iterates workstreams passes the name as an ARGUMENT (it cannot
 * set `GSD_WORKSTREAM` per iteration), and `planningDir` falls back to the env
 * only when `ws` is `undefined`, so an argument-driven call resolved this
 * convention from the ROOT config while reading that workstream's ROADMAP. Two
 * consequences, both reproduced: a workstream that explicitly declares its OWN
 * convention had it ignored — the root's value decided how the workstream's
 * roadmap was parsed, so flipping ONLY the root config changed which milestone
 * a workstream extracted; and `--workstream foo` disagreed with
 * `GSD_WORKSTREAM=foo` on the same repo.
 *
 * `undefined` (the default) keeps `planningDir`'s env fallback, so every
 * pre-#2761 call site is byte-identical; `null` means "explicitly no
 * workstream". Same discriminator `planningDir` and `getMilestonePhaseFilter`
 * already carry.
 *
 * SCOPE: this governs the #612 bracket-selection reads ONLY. The shipped
 * milestone-prefixed W021 gate keeps its own root-only read — re-basing a
 * legacy convention's gate onto a different config is a behaviour change to a
 * shipped check, in both directions, and is not part of read tolerance.
