 * #2562 / Bug #2445 / #2645 review: pick ONE winning item per key from a
 * PRE-SORTED list — newest `mtimeMs` wins; on an exact tie the incumbent
 * (first-in-sort-order) wins, since only a STRICTLY greater mtime replaces
 * it. `includeItem` lets a caller exclude items before comparison (e.g.
 * out-of-milestone directories) — critically, the filter runs BEFORE the
 * mtime comparison, so an excluded item can never win a tie or a comparison
 * against an included one.
 *
 * Extracted as the SINGLE shared implementation after a #2645 review found
 * two independently-written copies of this exact rule had silently
 * diverged: `workstream-inventory.cts`'s ledger-winner selection compared
 * raw mtimes with no scoping filter, while this module's own `rollupDirByKey`
 * (below) filtered out-of-milestone directories first. A stale out-of-
 * milestone directory with a newer mtime than the live in-milestone one
 * (plausible after a checkout/rebase resets mtimes) could then win the
 * LEDGER's selection while losing the BUILDER's — reopening #2645's own
 * hole for the phase that actually counts toward `completed_phases`,
 * reachable with a plain `rm` and no ledger tampering. A comment asserting
 * two hand-written copies "use the same rule" is not a guarantee they do;
 * one shared function is.

    //  - `heading` — operator-typed marker in the LIVE roadmap. Nothing has been
    //    archived, so every phase the milestone declares should be on disk and
    //    complete. Gate on the full ratio, which also catches the
    //    declared-but-never-scaffolded phases that have no directory to inspect.
    //  - `snapshot` — `milestones/<version>-ROADMAP.md`. The `milestone complete`
    //    run that writes it also MOVES the milestone's phase directories into
    //    `milestones/<version>-phases/` (milestone.cts:783-790) while COPYING —
    //    never truncating — the live ROADMAP (:700-702), so its Progress rows
    //    survive. A CLEAN archive therefore reads 0/N by construction, and gating
    //    it on the ratio alone would strip `milestone complete` from every
    //    archived milestone. But a live in-milestone directory means the archive
    //    is NOT clean — a phase was added or reopened after it, reachable because
    //    `milestone complete` does not advance STATE's `milestone:` field
    //    (state-transition.cts:83, :1335); only `/gsd-new-milestone` does (:1224).
    //    Once any in-milestone directory is live the ratio IS meaningful again, so
    //    the check is the conjunction. Requiring the live directory to itself be
    //    unfinished was too narrow: it let a complete live dir alongside a
    //    declared-but-unscaffolded phase reproduce the reported symptom, since a
    //    dirless phase has nothing to inspect.
    //
    // The whole cross-check is scoped-only, and NOT because of the signal: when
    // scoping is off, `effectivePhaseCount` is the whole-roadmap count and
    // membership is everything, so there is no current-milestone artifact set to
