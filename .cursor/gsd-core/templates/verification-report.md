## Guidelines

**Status values (overall, frontmatter `status:`):**
- `passed` — All must-haves verified, no blockers
- `gaps_found` — One or more critical gaps found
- `human_needed` — Automated checks pass but human verification required

**Per-truth states (Observable Truths `Status` column):**
- `✓ VERIFIED` — supporting artifacts pass all checks; for a behavior-dependent truth, a behavioral test exercised the asserted behavior
- `⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED` — present + wired, but a state transition or cancellation/cleanup/ordering invariant was not exercised by any test. Counts toward `behavior_unverified`, routes to human verification, and is *excluded* from the verified score. Per-truth only — on its own the overall `status:` becomes `human_needed` (unless a higher-precedence `gaps_found` also applies); the item is preserved in `behavior_unverified_items` regardless.
- `✓ VERIFIED (coincidental-reliance)` — an **advisory** qualifier on a truth that *is* verified but holds for an incidental reason rather than a guaranteed one (#1955): `undeclared-precondition` (state nothing in the phase's artifacts or a declared prerequisite guarantees), `incidental-ordering` (an order or side effect nothing in the code enforces), or `fixture-only` (the test's own setup establishes the precondition; the production path has no equivalent). The base `✓ VERIFIED` token is kept verbatim and leading, so it counts toward the verified score exactly as before — the advisory changes no score and no status, and never produces a human-verification item. Each flagged truth is listed in `coincidental_reliance_items` with the reason and what to harden. Not applied to a truth that never reached `✓ VERIFIED`, nor to a `PASSED (override)` truth.

  **Filling this column — apply the reliance check to every `✓ VERIFIED` truth before writing the row.** Ask why the truth holds and classify the evidence you already recorded, not your confidence in it. Flag it when the evidence names one of the three reasons above. Do NOT flag: a precondition the code establishes or explicitly defaults; ordering the code enforces (await, explicit sequencing); a fixture merely supplying input the real caller also supplies; unease naming no specific state, ordering, or fixture. The check is endogenous and so weaker than an exogenous tag (`gsd-core/references/honest-verifier.md`) — which is why it is advisory and never a gate. The usual fix is to promote the hidden assumption into a declared precondition.
- `✗ FAILED` — artifact missing, stub, or unwired
- `? UNCERTAIN` — can't verify programmatically

**Evidence types:**
- For EXISTS: "File at path, exports X"
- For SUBSTANTIVE: "N lines, has patterns X, Y, Z"
- For WIRED: "Line N: code that connects A to B"
- For FAILED: "Missing because X" or "Stub because Y"

**Severity levels:**
- 🛑 Blocker: Prevents goal achievement, must fix
- ⚠️ Warning: Indicates incomplete but doesn't block
- ℹ️ Info: Notable but not problematic

**Fix plan generation:**
- Only generate if gaps_found
- Group related fixes into single plans
- Keep to 2-3 tasks per plan
- Include verification task in each plan

**Anti-patterns:** 3 found (2 blockers, 1 warning)

## Human Verification Required

None needed until automated gaps are fixed.

## Gaps Summary

### Critical Gaps (Block Progress)

1. **Chat component is placeholder**
   - Missing: Actual message list rendering
   - Impact: Users see "Chat will be here" instead of messages
   - Fix: Implement Chat.tsx to fetch and render messages

2. **API routes are stubs**
   - Missing: Database integration in GET and POST
   - Impact: No data persistence, no real functionality
   - Fix: Wire prisma calls in route handlers

3. **No wiring between frontend and backend**
   - Missing: fetch calls in components
   - Impact: Even if API worked, UI wouldn't call it
   - Fix: Add useEffect fetch in Chat, onSubmit fetch in ChatInput

## Recommended Fix Plans

### 03-04-PLAN.md: Implement Chat API

**Objective:** Wire API routes to database

**Tasks:**
1. Implement GET /api/chat with prisma.message.findMany
2. Implement POST /api/chat with prisma.message.create
3. Verify: API returns real data, POST creates records

**Estimated scope:** Small

---

### 03-05-PLAN.md: Implement Chat UI

**Objective:** Wire Chat component to API

**Tasks:**
1. Implement Chat.tsx with useEffect fetch and message rendering
2. Wire ChatInput onSubmit to POST /api/chat
3. Verify: Messages display, new messages appear after send

**Estimated scope:** Small
