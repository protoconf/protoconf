/**
 * Install Surface Shadowing rule (#2873, epic #2866 Phase 4a — governed by
 * `.gsd/phase/feat-2873-cross-scope-shadowing/40-design.md`).
 *
 * One code, W028, surfacing `install-shadow-report.cts`'s `ShadowReport` as
 * a `/gsd-health` diagnostic — the design doc's row #4 ("one diagnostic,
 * severity WARNING, same projection" as the install-time report). WARNING
 * severity, ADVISE remedy with `risk: NONE`: shadowing is never auto-fixable
 * (there is no single correct scope to remove) so this is advisory only,
 * mirroring `agent-install.cts`'s W010 shape.
 *
 * Reaches OUTSIDE the planning snapshot the same way `agent-install.cts`
 * does for W010: `resolveRuntime(cwd)` (`runtime-slash.cjs`) resolves the
 * runtime id from `process.env.GSD_RUNTIME` / `config.runtime` / the
 * `'claude'` default (never throws), using `snapshot.cwd`
 * (`planning-snapshot.cts`'s `buildPlanningSnapshot` — `path.resolve(cwd)`)
 * as the project directory. `buildShadowReport` is then called with that
 * `cwd` so the local scope resolves against the project actually being
 * health-checked, while `home` is left un-injected so the resolver defaults
 * to `os.homedir()` — the real machine, same production call shape the
 * installer uses.
 *
 * `check(snapshot)` degrades to `[]` (never throws) whenever there is
 * nothing installable to report: `buildShadowReport` itself already
 * degrades an unresolvable runtime (`configHome.kind === 'none'`, e.g.
 * vscode — design row #7) to `reason: RESOLVER_UNAVAILABLE`, which
 * `renderShadowReport` renders as `[]`; the try/catch around both calls
 * below additionally absorbs any other unexpected throw (design row D5),
 * since this rule is advisory and must never make `/gsd-health` itself
 * fail.
 *
 * Design: .gsd/phase/feat-2873-cross-scope-shadowing/40-design.md
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: source in
 * src/health-diagnostic-rules/install-surface-shadowing.cts, compiled to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/health-diagnostic-rules/install-surface-shadowing.cjs
 * (gitignored).
