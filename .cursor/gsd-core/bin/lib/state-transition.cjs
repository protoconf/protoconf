 * the surrounding blank-line count) so `newBody`'s own leading/trailing
 * formatting is exactly what appears in the output.

/**
 * Apply a `patch` transition to STATE.md content.
 *
 * Migrates `cmdStatePatch` (state.cts) onto the substrate. Applies each
 * caller-supplied `{field: value}` pair, resolved BODY-FIRST:
 *
 * - A key that resolves against the STRIPPED body (via `stateReplaceField`,
 *   case-insensitive on the field name) is applied there and reported
 *   `updated` — this is the legitimate, documented case (display-cased body
 *   fields — Status, Current Plan, Phase — which are never frontmatter
 *   keys). It wins deterministically even when the same key also happens to
 *   exist as a parsed frontmatter key (e.g. `status` matches both the
 *   frontmatter key and a `Status:` body line) — frontmatter is inert for
 *   that key.
 * - Only when the body has no match is the key checked against parsed
 *   frontmatter (determined structurally, never by a naming heuristic), and
 *   routed through the seam: `FIELD_CLASSIFICATION` governs it. A CLASSIFIED
 *   key (has a row, e.g. `current_phase`, `current_phase_name`) is NOT
 *   writable by an arbitrary patch — policy owns it — and is reported
 *   `failed`. An UNCLASSIFIED key (no row, e.g. a custom `risk_level`) is a
 *   pass-through per Phase 1 behavior-table row 19 ("field absent from
 *   FIELD_CLASSIFICATION → untouched pass-through"): it is applied directly
 *   to the frontmatter object before reassembly and reported `updated`.
 * - A key matching neither the body nor the frontmatter is reported `failed`.
 *
 * ADR-3408 §8.3(b): this used to run `stateReplaceField` over the FULL
 * document (body + frontmatter), which — because `field` is an arbitrary,
 * caller-supplied string, unlike every other `stateReplaceField` call site in
 * this file, which passes a fixed Title-Case string literal that can never
 * collide with a lowercase/snake_case YAML key — let a frontmatter-shaped
 * patch key (e.g. `status`, `current_phase`) match and rewrite the YAML
 * frontmatter block directly via `stateReplaceField`'s case-insensitive
 * `^field:` line pattern, entirely outside `FIELD_CLASSIFICATION` and the
 * write-seam preservation policy: a second, undeclared writer. The fix is
 * that a CLASSIFIED frontmatter key no longer writes outside the declared
 * policy table — not that every frontmatter-shaped key stops working.
 * `.gsd/phase/refactor-3469-one-write-seam/40-design.md` row 9 requires
 * frontmatter changes to route through the seam (still work, governed by
 * FIELD_CLASSIFICATION), not to stop working outright. Body-shaped keys
 * (`Status`, `Current Plan`, `Phase`, ...) are the LEGITIMATE case and are
 * unaffected — they were always matched against the body text, and still are.
 *
 * The curated-field preservation that fixes #1743/#1695 is NOT in this core —
 * it lives in the write seam's post-sync delta (table-driven via
 * `current_phase_name`'s `preserve-when-unchanged` row, ADR-3408 §8.1 —
 * reclassified from `preserve-always` in #3468 to match its long-standing,
 * delta-gated behavior).
 * `patch` consulting the table "refuses to overwrite" curated fields implicitly:
 * when the patch does not change a curated field's body source line, the
 * existing frontmatter value wins over the sync re-derivation. The adapter
 * still owns field-name validation (security) and the resync-progress decision.
 *
 * `data.updated` / `data.failed` mirror the pre-migration CLI output shape.
