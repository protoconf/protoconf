 * text-lines.cts — the line-terminator seam (ADR-3212 §3, epic #3212 Phase 2,
 * #3413).
 *
 * Source in src/text-lines.cts, compiled to gsd-core/bin/lib/text-lines.cjs
 * (gitignored), per the repo's ADR-457 build-at-publish convention.
 *
 * Sole owner of `\r?\n` splitting and CRLF normalization. Closes #3360: a
 * regex anchored on `^`/`$` under `/m` against a whole multi-line string is
 * exposed to `\r` being its own LineTerminator (ECMA-262), so a greedy `\s*`
 * can cross a CRLF boundary and inflate a captured indent by one character.
 * Split-then-match — call `splitLines` first, then match per already-split
 * line — is immune by construction, because a single split line can never
 * contain the delimiter that produced it. This module exists so that shape
 * is the easy, obvious way to write indentation-sensitive parsing, per the
 * design doc (.gsd/phase/chore-3413-text-lines-seam/40-design.md).
 *
 * A "genuine leaf" module (CONTEXT.md's term, shared with Phase 1's sibling
 * seam `src/pattern.cts`): zero I/O, zero imports from other `src/*.cts`
 * modules, pure string functions only.
