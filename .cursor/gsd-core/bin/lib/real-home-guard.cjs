/**
 * #3712 — refuse to let an in-process test run reach the developer's REAL home.
 *
 * NAMED `real-home-guard`, NOT `test-home-guard`: this is a SOURCE module, and a
 * source filename matching Node's `test-*` convention gets COLLECTED and EXECUTED
 * as a test by the remote runner, which never imports it and throws immediately
 * on load — proven against the unmodified `next` tip 622f43353 (linux-node24,
 * 37199 passed / 1 failed, failure at `src/test-home-guard.cts`). Meanwhile
 * `scripts/run-tests.cjs` only globs `tests/**\/*.test.cjs`, so GitHub CI never
 * sees the failure and stays green while the remote push-gate runner goes red.
 * Any name works except one matching `test-*`, `*-test`, `*_test`, `*.test.*`,
 * or `test.*`.
 *
 * A runtime kind may declare a global `home` override that is resolved from
 * `os.homedir()` rather than from the caller's `configDir` (today: codex's
 * skills kind, `home: ".agents"`, ADR-1239 / #2088 — Codex auto-discovers
 * global skills from `$HOME/.agents/skills`). Sandboxing `configDir`/`targetDir`
 * therefore does NOT contain such a kind, and no `assertDestWithinConfigHome`
 * check can see it: that gate confines a destSubpath to whatever root it is
 * handed, and here the root IS the escaped home.
 *
 * The live defect: an in-process caller that forgot to sandbox HOME installed —
 * and, via `_removeGsdEntries` / `_syncGsdDir`, PRUNED — inside the real
 * `~/.agents/skills`, deleting every `gsd-*` skill (observed 71 -> 0, a foreign
 * `cloudflare` skill surviving) while the suite still exited 0. It is silent
 * because the runtime's own config home is untouched, so the manifest keeps
 * reporting a healthy install.
 *
 * This lives in its own module because SIX writers resolve a kind `home` and then
 * write or destroy what is under it. Four are reachable today —
 * `installRuntimeArtifacts` and `uninstallRuntimeArtifacts` (install-engine.cts)
 * and `applySurface` (surface.cts); guarding only the install path, as the first
 * cut of this fix did, left the other two as live bypasses. Two more are
 * descriptor-dependent and guarded against a future descriptor change rather than
 * a present escape: `installOpencodeFamilySkills`, which sits behind the
 * combined-family early return and honors `skillsKindEntry.home` (no
 * combined-family runtime declares one), and `installAgentsKindStandalone`, which
 * honors `agentsKindEntry.home` and prunes it (antigravity's global agents kind declares one since #3738; it was the first agents-kind override).
 * The sixth is `migrateLegacyDevPreferencesToSkill`, which resolves the skills
 * kind's `home` and writes `SKILL.md` under it. It CREATES rather than prunes,
 * which is why the first pass of this fix missed it, and it runs from
 * `_runLegacyInstallMigrations` — i.e. BEFORE `installRuntimeArtifacts`' own
 * assertion — so it carries its own call.
 *
 * DETECTION — three signals, in order:
 *
 *   1. `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` is set by `node --test` and inherited by children, and
 *      is absent from normal installs outside a Node test context, so ordinary
 *      production installs are untouched. Precisely: an install spawned BENEATH a
 *      `node --test` process with an un-sandboxed HOME is refused — that is the
 *      point, and it is also why this is not stated as "never affects installs".
 *      `GSD_TEST_MODE` is NOT usable: several in-process test files — including
 *      the one that caused #3712 — never set it, so gating on it would miss the
 *      exact case this guard exists for.
 *   2. `os.userInfo().homedir` reads the passwd entry and ignores `$HOME`, while
 *      `os.homedir()` prefers `$HOME`. They disagree exactly when a caller
 *      redirected HOME and agree when one forgot. This is the PRIMARY signal and
 *      the only one used whenever a passwd entry is readable. It is asked about
 *      the DESTINATION, not about HOME state: a destination outside the passwd
 *      home is allowed, and one inside it is refused UNLESS it sits beneath a
 *      HOME that was sandboxed away from the passwd home. That last exemption is
 *      not a softening — on Windows the temp root is inside the user's home, so
 *      without it every sandboxed run is refused (#3725). Both halves are
 *      required; see `derivesFromSandboxedHome`.
 *   3. `SANDBOX_MARKER` — consulted ONLY when the passwd entry cannot be read.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED, with one named exception. If the passwd entry is unreadable
 * (some CI images) we cannot establish that HOME is sandboxed, so a home-override
 * kind is refused rather than allowed — UNLESS the marker below names the home in
 * effect. That branch is a deliberate weakening, not a closed door: with no passwd
 * entry there is nothing that could contradict a marker naming the real home, so a
 * caller that sandboxed to its own real home would be believed. The alternative is
 * refusing every run on such a host. Everything else in that branch answers NO
 * when it cannot tell — see `sameDirectory`. The cost of a false refusal is a failed test naming its own fix;
 * the cost of a false allow is silent, unrecoverable deletion of a developer's
 * skills.
 *
 * The marker carries the sandbox PATH, not a boolean, and is checked only in that
 * unreadable-passwd branch — deliberately, because a boolean checked first is not
 * proof of anything. An ambient or stale `=1` inherited from a parent process, or
 * left set by an earlier in-process test, would have disarmed the guard entirely
 * even when HOME plainly equalled the passwd home. Requiring the value to EQUAL
 * the home now in effect means a leftover marker from some other directory cannot
 * vouch for this call.

 * KNOWN LIMITATION — a subordinate BIND MOUNT of the real `~/.agents` at
 * `<sandbox>/.agents` is NOT closed by this. A bind mount is not a link:
 * `realpathSync` keeps the mount-point spelling, so the canonical destination
 * still reads as "beneath the sandbox" while the write reaches the real
