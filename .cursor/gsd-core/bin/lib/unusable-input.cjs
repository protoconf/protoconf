/**
 * Unusable Input Diagnostic — the out-of-band half of ADR-1411's
 * "corrupt is not absent" amendment (epic #1879).
 *
 * ADR-1411 splits the amendment's mechanism in two. Where a read already returns a
 * provenance envelope, the cause is named *in-band* — that is `ConfigResolution.reason`
 * (#1880, shipped). Where a read returns a bare sentinel or a plausible default it cannot
 * extend, the return value is preserved exactly and the cause is surfaced *out-of-band*,
 * as a deduplicated diagnostic on stderr. This module owns that second mechanism.
 *
 * It exists as a shared seam rather than a pattern copied per site because four call sites
 * across four modules need identical behaviour (#1882 frontmatter, #1881 roadmap-parser,
 * #1883 planning-workspace/verify, #1884 planning lock). Four hand-rolled copies of one
 * behaviour is `DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX` by construction; one seam with a frozen reason set
 * is the documented cure.
 *
 * Two contracts this module must not break:
 *
 *  - **Unconditional.** ADR-1411 diverges deliberately from ADR-227's never-implemented
 *    `GSD_DEBUG` opt-in: "an opt-in nobody sets is indistinguishable from the silence
 *    #1879 is about". There is no config gate here, by design.
 *  - **Never throws.** Callers are leaf readers that promised a total function. A failed
 *    stderr write (closed stream, EPIPE) must not turn a silent degradation into a crash.
