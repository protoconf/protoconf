// gsd-cursor-subagent-start.js — Cursor subagentStart hook (ADR-1239 / #2089,
// isolation guard #3045)
//
// Cursor invokes this script when a subagent session starts.
// Protocol: JSON from Cursor on stdin; JSON response on stdout.
//
// Input schema (cursor subagentStart) — Cursor's hooks contract is a COMMON
// envelope shared by every hook, PLUS event-specific fields layered on top
// (cursor.com/docs/hooks, "Reference > Common schema"). A prior version of
// this comment documented only the envelope and omitted the event-specific
// fields entirely — that omission is exactly what caused #3045's isolation
// guard work to stall on a false schema conflict, so every field below is
// still read defensively (assume any of them may be absent/malformed):
//   Common envelope (all hooks): conversation_id, generation_id, model,
//     model_id, model_params, hook_event_name, cursor_version,
//     workspace_roots (array of paths), user_email, transcript_path.
//     (Some fields are omitted for app-lifecycle hooks; this script's own
//     prior comment listed session_id/is_background_agent instead of
//     model_id/model_params — the exact set observed is not guaranteed.)
//   subagentStart-specific additions: subagent_id, subagent_type, task,
//     parent_conversation_id, tool_call_id, subagent_model,
//     is_parallel_worker, git_branch (optional).
//
// Output schema (cursor subagentStart):
//   { additional_context?: string, permission?: "allow"|"deny", user_message?: string }
//   "ask" is NOT a supported permission value for subagentStart — Cursor
//   treats it as "deny". This script only ever emits "allow" (by omitting
//   `permission`, preserving the pre-#3045 output shape) or an explicit
//   "deny" with `user_message`.
//
// Behaviour:
//   - Injects a brief GSD state reminder so subagents (planner, executor,
//     verifier) have the current phase context (unchanged since #2587).
//   - NEW (#3045): denies spawning a GSD executor subagent when this
//     project's dispatch isolation resolves to "harness-worktree" but the
//     session is NOT actually running isolated from the user's primary
//     checkout. Cursor's `--worktree` is a SESSION-level flag (no per-call
//     isolation parameter exists on `subagentStart`, unlike Claude's
//     `Agent(isolation=...)` kwarg), so this guard verifies EFFECTIVE STATE
//     instead of looking for a flag — see resolveIsolationDecision() below.
//   - Fails open on a payload it cannot parse or that carries fields it does
//     not need: never throws, never blocks a call it cannot evaluate.
//     Isolation resolution itself fails CLOSED (denies) for the two cases
//     that are load-bearing and are NOT the same as "cannot parse": (a) a
//     GSD project resolved to harness-worktree whose isolation state cannot
//     be verified, and (b) a harness-worktree GSD project dispatch with no
//     usable subagent_type — a guard that cannot verify must not answer
//     "safe" (#3050).

 * Resolve whether `root` is running in a session Cursor ISOLATED FOR THIS

 *
 * #3045 security review (finding 3): "is a linked git worktree" is NOT "is
 * isolated from the tree the human is using". A developer who opens Cursor
 * directly in a hand-made `git worktree add` checkout — routine, see
 * `.claude/worktrees/` in this very repo — is not protected by anything;
 * nothing stops them from also editing that same checkout by hand. The ONLY
 * signal that actually proves harness isolation is that `root` resolves
 * under Cursor's OWN managed worktree root (`<cursor config dir>/worktrees`,
 * i.e. `~/.cursor/worktrees` by default — `getGlobalConfigDir('cursor')`
 * honors the `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` env override and `~` expansion for free).
 * That is made NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT below. Do NOT reinstate
 * `resolveWorktreeLinkage`'s `linked_worktree_root` mode as an alternative
 * OR'd proof of isolation — that is precisely the bypass finding 3 closed;
 * a future "simplification" that merges it back in re-opens unconsented
 * writes to the human's active checkout.
 *
 * `resolveWorktreeLinkage` is still called, but ONLY as a diagnostic: it
 * distinguishes "confidently not isolated" from "git could not answer
 * (timeout) — cannot determine" so the eventual deny reason stays
 * actionable. Its result never flips `isolated`.
 *
 * Both the workspace root and the managed root are realpath'd before
 * comparison (#3045 finding 2) — lexical `path.relative` alone is spoofable
 * by a symlink or bind mount at either location, plantable by any process
 * running with the user's permissions (including an agent already inside a
 * legitimately isolated worktree, which has shell access by design).
 * `fs.realpathSync` throwing (nonexistent path) never propagates — it
 * degrades to "cannot resolve", never to "isolated". realpath also resolves
 * the `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR`-derived managed root itself (not just `root`), so a
 * symlinked or case-differing `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` (case-insensitive
 * filesystems normalize to on-disk casing via realpath's dirent walk, not
 * string comparison) is covered on BOTH sides of the comparison, not only
 * `root`'s.
 *
 * Returns `{ isolated: true|false, cannotDetermine: bool, notApplicable: bool }`.
 * `notApplicable` (#3045 MAJOR 3) is true only for a confidently-not-a-git-repo
 * root — see the `not_git_repo` branch below.
 *
 * `realpath` is injectable (`(p: string) => string`, throws like
 * `fs.realpathSync` on an unresolvable path; defaults to the real
 * `fs.realpathSync`) per the repo's clock-seam-style dependency-injection
 * convention. This lets tests drive the exact spoof-resistance logic this
 * function exists for (a symlink at the managed root pointing OUTSIDE it)
 * with an injected resolution mapping, in-process, on every platform —
 * without creating a real directory symlink, which requires elevated

 *      deny a dispatch this guard was never going to enforce against),
 *   2. a workspace root is resolvable from `workspace_roots`,
 *   3. that root is a GSD project (`.planning/config.json` exists there),
 *   4. the resolved dispatch isolation is `harness-worktree`,
 *   5. `subagent_type` identifies a GSD executor (or is missing/malformed —
 *      see the cannot-determine case below),
 *   6. the session is NOT actually isolated (resolveIsolationEvidence).
 *
 * No workspace root at all degrades to allow (step 2), mirroring
 * hooks/gsd-agent-isolation-guard.js's own "not a GSD project → allow"
 * branch: project-existence is the gate that makes fail-closed apply in the
 * first place, so being unable to even locate a candidate project is not
 * itself a fail-closed trigger — it is the same "not a GSD project" shape
 * that guard already treats as inert.
 *
 * Two DISTINCT fail-closed ("cannot determine") reasons per #3050's lesson
 * that a guard which cannot verify must not answer "safe" — both scoped to
 * "GSD project resolved to harness-worktree", never to a dispatch already
 * confirmed to be a non-executor:
 *   - this project's dispatch-isolation configuration cannot be read/resolved
 *     (registry require/parse failure, or config.json unreadable),
 *   - `subagent_type` is missing or not a usable non-empty string on a
 *     dispatch this guard could not rule out as an executor.
 *
 * Isolation resolution (#3045 BLOCKER fix, see hooks/lib/isolation-sentinel.js):
 * prefers the workflow's own PERSISTED per-dispatch decision (the sentinel
 * `record-dispatch-isolation` writes) over re-deriving a host CAPABILITY from
 * the registry. `none`/`orchestrator-worktree` from a fresh sentinel ALLOW
 * immediately — sequential/orchestrator-managed dispatch is legitimate. An
 * absent/stale sentinel falls back to `resolveFallbackIsolation` (registry +
 * `workflow.use_worktrees`, runtime resolved GSD_RUNTIME env >
 * .planning/config.json `runtime` key > 'cursor'). The default is
 * confidently "cursor" here — UNLIKE hooks/gsd-agent-isolation-guard.js's own
 * fallback, which must treat "no explicit signal" as cannot-determine
 * because that hook installs across every `hostIntegration.hooksSurface ===
 * 'settings-json'` runtime — because THIS script only ever runs as Cursor's
 * own subagentStart hook; there is no other host it could be executing
 * under, so defaulting to 'cursor' is a confirmed fact of the execution
 * context, not a guess (#3045 MINOR — this note replaces a prior comment
 * that inaccurately claimed to "mirror" runtime-slash.cjs's resolveRuntime,
 * which defaults to 'claude'; the two intentionally diverge).
 *
 * #3045 security review (finding 1): applicability step 2 above now means
 * "a workspace root is resolvable", plural — resolveIsolationDecision
 * evaluates EVERY entry of `workspace_roots` via evaluateRootIsolation() and
 * denies on the first one that fails. `subagent_type` is still resolved
 * exactly once, up front, before any root is touched (applicability step 1
 * stays a single check, not per-root — an unreadable config on one root must
 * never even be attempted for a confirmed non-executor dispatch).
