## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-inbox` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
One-command triage of the project's GitHub inbox. Fetches all open issues and PRs,
reviews each against the corresponding template requirements (feature, enhancement,
bug, chore, fix PR, enhancement PR, feature PR), reports completeness and compliance,
and optionally applies labels or closes non-compliant submissions.

**Flow:** Detect repo → Fetch open issues + PRs → Classify each by type → Review against template → Report findings → Optionally act (label, comment, close)
</objective>
