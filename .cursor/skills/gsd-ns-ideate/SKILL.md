## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-ns-ideate` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

Route to the appropriate exploration / capture skill based on the user's intent.
`gsd-note`, `gsd-add-todo`, `gsd-add-backlog`, and `gsd-plant-seed` were folded
into `gsd-capture` (with `--note`, default, `--backlog`, `--seed` modes) by
#2790. The capture target lists pending todos via `--list`.

| User wants | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Explore an idea or opportunity | gsd-explore |
| Sketch out a rough design or plan | gsd-sketch |
| Time-boxed technical spike | gsd-spike |
| Write a spec for a phase | gsd-spec-phase |
| Capture a thought (todo / note / backlog / seed) | gsd-capture |

Invoke the matched skill directly using the Skill tool.
