<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-code-review` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Review source files changed during a phase for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality problems.

Spawns the gsd-code-reviewer agent to analyze code at the specified depth level. Produces REVIEW.md artifact in the phase directory with severity-classified findings.

Arguments:
- Phase number (required) — which phase's changes to review (e.g., "2" or "02")
- `--depth=quick|standard|deep` (optional) — review depth level, overrides workflow.code_review_depth config
  - quick: Pattern-matching only (~2 min)
  - standard: Per-file analysis with language-specific checks (~5-15 min, default)
  - deep: Cross-file analysis including import graphs and call chains (~15-30 min)
- `--files file1,file2,...` (optional) — explicit comma-separated file list, skips SUMMARY/git scoping (highest precedence for scoping)
- `--fix` (optional) — after review completes (or if REVIEW.md already exists), auto-apply fixes found. Spawns gsd-code-fixer agent. Accepts sub-flags:
  - `--all` — include Info findings in fix scope (default: Critical + Warning only)
  - `--auto` — enable fix + re-review iteration loop, capped at 3 iterations

Output: {padded_phase}-REVIEW.md in phase directory + inline summary of findings

</execution_context>

<context>
Phase: {{GSD_ARGS}} (first positional argument is phase number)

Optional flags parsed from {{GSD_ARGS}}:
- `--depth=VALUE` — Depth override (quick|standard|deep). If provided, overrides workflow.code_review_depth config.
- `--files=file1,file2,...` — Explicit file list override. Has highest precedence for file scoping per D-08. When provided, workflow skips SUMMARY.md extraction and git diff fallback entirely.

Context files (.cursor/rules/, SUMMARY.md, phase state) are resolved inside the workflow via `gsd-tools query init.phase-op` and delegated to agent via `<required_reading>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
This command is a thin dispatch layer. It parses arguments and delegates to the workflow.

Execute end-to-end.

The workflow (not this command) enforces these gates:
- Phase validation (before config gate)
- Config gate check (workflow.code_review)
- File scoping (--files override > SUMMARY.md > git diff fallback)
- Empty scope check (skip if no files)
- Agent spawning (gsd-code-reviewer)
- Result presentation (inline summary + next steps)
</process>
