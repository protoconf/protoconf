<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-add-tests` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Generate unit and E2E tests for a completed phase, using its SUMMARY.md, CONTEXT.md, and VERIFICATION.md as specifications.

Analyzes implementation files, classifies them into TDD (unit), E2E (browser), or Skip categories, presents a test plan for user approval, then generates tests following RED-GREEN conventions.

Output: Test files committed with message `test(phase-{N}): add unit and E2E tests from add-tests command`
