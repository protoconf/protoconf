## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-profile-user` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Generate a developer behavioral profile from session analysis (or questionnaire) and produce artifacts (USER-PROFILE.md, `gsd-dev-preferences` skill config, .cursor/rules/ section) that personalize Claude's responses.

Routes to the profile-user workflow which orchestrates the full flow: consent gate, session analysis or questionnaire fallback, profile generation, result display, and artifact selection.
</objective>

@/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.cursor/gsd-core/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Flags from {{GSD_ARGS}}:
- `--questionnaire` -- Skip session analysis entirely, use questionnaire-only path
- `--refresh` -- Rebuild profile even when one exists, backup old profile, show dimension diff
</context>

<process>
Execute the profile-user workflow end-to-end.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Initialization and existing profile detection
2. Consent gate before session analysis
3. Session scanning and data sufficiency checks
4. Session analysis (profiler agent) or questionnaire fallback
5. Cross-project split resolution
6. Profile writing to USER-PROFILE.md
7. Result display with report card and highlights
8. Artifact selection (dev-preferences, .cursor/rules/ sections)
9. Sequential artifact generation
10. Summary with refresh diff (if applicable)
</process>
