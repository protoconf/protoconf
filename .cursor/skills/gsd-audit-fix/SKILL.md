description: "Autonomous audit-to-fix pipeline — find issues, classify, fix, test, commit"

<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-audit-fix` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Run an audit, classify findings as auto-fixable vs manual-only, then autonomously fix
auto-fixable issues with test verification and atomic commits.

Flags:
- `--max N` — maximum findings to fix (default: 5)
- `--severity high|medium|all` — minimum severity to process (default: medium)
- `--dry-run` — classify findings without fixing (shows classification table)
- `--source <audit>` — which audit to run (default: audit-uat)
</objective>
