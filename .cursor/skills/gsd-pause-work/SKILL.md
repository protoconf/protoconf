<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-pause-work` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions.

Routes to the pause-work workflow which handles:
- Current phase detection from recent files
- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)
- Handoff file creation with all context sections
- Git commit as WIP
- Resume instructions
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.cursor/gsd-core/workflows/pause-work.md
</execution_context>

<context>
State and phase progress are gathered in-workflow with targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
If `--report` is in {{GSD_ARGS}}:
Read and execute `/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.cursor/gsd-core/workflows/session-report.md` end-to-end.

**Follow the pause-work workflow**.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Phase directory detection
2. State gathering with user clarifications
3. Handoff file writing with timestamp
4. Git commit
5. Confirmation with resume instructions
</process>
