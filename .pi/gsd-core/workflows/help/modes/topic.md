Apply response_language to all user-facing prose — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, and findings included; preserve code, paths, and identifiers.

<purpose>
Emit a section from the full reference for the topic in `$ARGUMENTS`. Read `workflows/help/modes/full.md`, resolve the topic alias to a section heading using the table below, and output the resolved-routing preamble plus the section content. Scope is controlled by a `--brief` flag in `$ARGUMENTS`: full scope (default) emits the entire section; compact scope (`--brief <topic>`) emits only the signature line + one-line summary for a compact scoped lookup. No additions, no surrounding chrome.

**Topic resolution table.** Match the topic alias case-insensitively. Strip a single leading `--` if present.

**Output rules:**

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: detect a `--brief` (or `-b`) flag — this selects **compact scope**. Otherwise scope is **full**. Strip the flag, then take the remaining token (with a single leading `--` stripped) as the topic alias.
2. Resolve the alias against the table.
3. If no match: emit a one-line error followed by a comma-separated list of the canonical topic names from the leftmost column (one per row, deduplicated). Suggest `/gsd:help --full` for the complete reference. Stop.
4. If matched: emit a single resolved-routing preamble line so the user sees what was matched:

   ```text
   **Topic:** `<alias>` → `<heading>` *(scope: full | compact)*
   ```

   Use the canonical alias from the leftmost column. Use the literal heading text from the matched cell. State the scope you are about to emit.

5. Read `workflows/help/modes/full.md`. Strip `<reference>` / `</reference>` wrapper tags — never emit them. Apply the extraction rule for the matched table cell, modulated by scope:

   5a. **Single section** (cell contains a single `` `## Heading` `` or `` `### Heading` ``):
   - *Full scope:* emit from that heading up to (but not including) the next sibling or higher-level heading.
   - *Compact scope:* emit the heading, then the first `` **`/gsd:...`** `` bold line within the section (the signature) and the single non-blank line immediately after it (the one-line summary). If the section has no `` **`/gsd:...`** `` bold line, emit the heading and the first paragraph.

   5b. **Multiple sections joined by "plus"**: apply rule 5a to each listed section in document order and emit them sequentially with no gap between them.

   5c. **Sub-block** (cell says `the /gsd:X block under ### Heading` or `the /gsd:X ... blocks under ### Heading`): within the named heading's section, start at each `` **`/gsd:X ...`** `` bold line.
   - *Full scope:* stop immediately before the next `` **`/gsd:...`** `` bold line or the next heading, whichever comes first.
   - *Compact scope:* emit the bold line and the single non-blank line immediately after it (the one-line summary).

   For cells listing multiple sub-blocks, emit them sequentially.

6. After the section content, emit a single closing line:

   ```text
   More: /gsd:help --full · /gsd:help <topic> · /gsd:help --brief <topic>
   ```

7. No project-specific commentary, no follow-up questions.
