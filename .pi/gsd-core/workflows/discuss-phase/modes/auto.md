# --auto mode — fully autonomous discuss-phase

> **Lazy-loaded.** Read this file from `workflows/discuss-phase.md` when
> `--auto` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`. After the discussion completes, the
> parent's `auto_advance` step also reads `modes/chain.md` to drive the
> auto-advance to plan-phase.

## Effect across steps

- **`check_existing`**: if CONTEXT.md exists, auto-select "Update it" — load
  existing context and continue to `analyze_phase` (matches the parent step's
  documented `--auto` branch). If no context exists, continue without
  prompting. For interrupted checkpoints, auto-select "Resume". For existing
  plans, auto-select "Continue and replan after". Log every decision so the
  user can audit.
- **`cross_reference_todos`**: fold all todos with relevance score >= 0.4
  automatically. Log the selection.
- **`present_gray_areas`**: auto-select ALL gray areas. Log:
  `[--auto] Selected all gray areas: [list area names].`
- **`discuss_areas`**: for each discussion question, choose the recommended
  option (first option, or the one explicitly marked "recommended") **without
  using AskUserQuestion**. Skip interactive prompts entirely. Log each
  auto-selected choice inline so the user can review decisions in the
  context file:
  ```
  [auto] [Area] — Q: "[question text]" → Selected: "[chosen option]" (recommended default)
  ```
- After all areas are auto-resolved, skip the "Explore more gray areas"
  prompt and proceed directly to `write_context`.
- After `write_context`, **auto-advance** to plan-phase via `modes/chain.md`.

## CRITICAL — Auto-mode pass cap

In `--auto` mode, the discuss step MUST complete in a **single pass**. After
writing CONTEXT.md once, you are DONE — proceed immediately to
`write_context` and then auto_advance. Do NOT re-read your own CONTEXT.md to
find "gaps", "undefined types", or "missing decisions" and run additional
passes. This creates a self-feeding loop where each pass generates references
that the next pass treats as gaps, consuming unbounded time and resources.

If you have already written and committed CONTEXT.md, the discuss step is
complete. Move on.

## Combination rules

- `--auto --text` / `--auto --batch`: text/batch overlays are no-ops in
  auto mode (no user prompts to render).
- `--auto --analyze`: trade-off tables can still be logged for the audit
  trail; selection still uses the recommended option.
- `--auto --power`: `--power` wins (power mode generates files for offline
  answering — incompatible with autonomous selection).
