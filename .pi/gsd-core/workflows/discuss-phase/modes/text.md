Apply response_language to all user-facing prose — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, and findings included; preserve code, paths, and identifiers.

# --text mode — plain-text overlay (no AskUserQuestion)

> **Lazy-loaded overlay.** Read this file from `workflows/discuss-phase.md`
> when `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`, OR when
> `workflow.text_mode: true` is set in config (e.g., per-project default).

## Effect

When text mode is active, **do not use AskUserQuestion at all**. Instead,
present every question as a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to
type their choice number. Free-text input maps to the "Other" branch of
the equivalent AskUserQuestion call.

This is required for Claude Code remote sessions (`/rc` mode) where the
Claude App cannot forward TUI menu selections back to the host.

## Activation

- Per-session: pass `--text` flag to any command (e.g.,
  `/gsd:discuss-phase --text`)
- Per-project: `gsd_run query config-set workflow.text_mode true`

Text mode applies to ALL workflows in the session, not just discuss-phase.

## Question rendering

Replace this:
```text
AskUserQuestion(
  header="Layout",
  question="How should posts be displayed?",
  options=["Cards", "List", "Timeline"]
)
```

With this:
```text
Layout — How should posts be displayed?
  1. Cards
  2. List
  3. Timeline
  4. Other (type freeform)

Reply with a number, or describe your preference.
```

Wait for the user's reply at the normal prompt. Parse:
- Numeric reply → mapped to that option
- Free text → treated as "Other" — reflect it back, confirm, then proceed

## Empty-answer handling

The same answer-validation rules from the parent file apply: empty
responses trigger one retry, then a clarifying question. Do not proceed
with empty input.
