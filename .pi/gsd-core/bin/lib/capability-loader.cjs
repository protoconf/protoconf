/**
 * capability-loader.cts — runtime Capability Registry overlay (ADR-1244 D2).
 *
 * Promotes the registry from a frozen data file to a module with an interface:
 *
 *     loadRegistry({ includeInstalled }) -> composed registry
 *
 * It composes the **first-party frozen registry** (the committed, generated
 * `capability-registry.cjs`) with a **validated installed overlay** — third-party
 * capability manifests read at runtime from per-scope install roots:
 *   - global:  $GSD_HOME/.gsd/capabilities/<id>/capability.json  (GSD_HOME defaults to ~)
 *   - project: <projectRoot>/.gsd/capabilities/<id>/capability.json
 *
 * Invariants enforced over the merged set (first-party ∪ overlay):
 *   - First-party always wins: an overlay whose `id`, owned skill/agent stem, or
 *     federated config key collides with first-party (or uses a reserved `gsd-` /
 *     `gsd-core-` / `anthropic-` id prefix) is rejected.
 *   - Load-time re-gate (default-resilient): an overlay that fails validation or
 *     whose `engines.gsd` does not satisfy the running GSD version is SKIPPED
 *     with a warning — it never crashes the loop. A skipped capability that
 *     declares a `gate` is additionally recorded in
 *     `_overlay.incompatibleGateCapIds` / `_overlay.blockedGates` so the loop
 *     resolver can surface a loud fail-OPEN advisory for that gate (#2009): the
 *     un-evaluable gate is skipped (not enforced) with a remediation message,
 *     rather than silently vanishing.
 *
 * The merged registry is materialized by the canonical `buildRegistry`
 * (re-exported from the generator, which ships) over a cap-map reconstructed
 * from the frozen registry's capability objects plus the accepted overlay
 * capabilities — so every derived view (bySkill, byLoopPoint, configSchema,
 * capabilityClusters, profileMembership, …) is computed by exactly one builder
 * and cannot drift from the first-party path.
 *
 * Install never executes capability code here (staging/exec belongs to ADR-1244
 * D3/D5); this module only READS and VALIDATES declarations.
