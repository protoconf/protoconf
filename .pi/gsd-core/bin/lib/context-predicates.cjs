/**
 * Context Predicates — CONTEXT.md predicate fact-store parser.
 *
 * Ported from the reference prototype
 * `examples/dynamic-context-management/context-predicates.cjs` (ADR-1671,
 * "Dynamic context management platform", Option-E predicate fact-store).
 * Behavior is preserved BYTE-FOR-BEHAVIOR from the prototype for the parts it
 * shares: `ID_RE`, the first-`=` split, the naive triple-backtick fence
 * toggle, and the `- ` list-item-only form. Known prototype defects are
 * DELIBERATELY carried forward here — a later commit fixes them behind a
 * failing-first test.
 *
 * Two intentional deviations from the prototype (ADR-1671 open question 4):
 *   - `Duplicate` carries `count`, not `lines: number[]`.
 *   - `ContextIndex.predicates` entries carry `{id, klass, value}` with NO
 *     `line` field — a committed artifact with no line numbers cannot drift
 *     on a line shift. The live parse result (`Predicate`) still carries
 *     `line` and `section`.
 *
 * One addition beyond the prototype: `ParseResult.malformed` collects
 * backtick lines that look like a predicate declaration attempt (contains a
 * backtick-wrapped `id=value`-shaped inner with an `=` at index >= 1) but are
 * rejected, with a distinct named `reason` per rejection class: `empty-value`
 * (e.g. `` `ID=` ``), `empty-segment` (a doubled dot in the id, e.g.
 * `` `A..b=1` ``), `invalid-id-chars` (disallowed characters in the id, e.g. a
 * space: `` `FOO BAR=1` ``), `lowercase-leading-class` (id's first segment
 * starts lowercase, e.g. `` `foo.bar=1` ``), and `value-contains-newline` (an
 * embedded CR/LF/U+2028/U+2029 in the value). A line with no `=` at all (e.g.
 * `` `ID` ``, ordinary inline code) is NOT a declaration attempt and never
 * produces a diagnostic. This does not change any accept/reject outcome —
 * only adds diagnostics.
 *
 * Grammar (from discovery facts):
 *   Two line forms, each on exactly one source line:
 *     1. Bare backtick-wrapped, optionally indented: `ID=value`, `  `ID=value``
 *     2. List-item backtick: `-`/`*`/`+`/`N.` marker followed by `ID=value`
 *
 *   ID grammar: CLASS(.subkey)*  where CLASS = first dot-separated segment.
 *   ID chars: [A-Za-z0-9._-]  (CLASS always uppercase; subkeys may be mixed).
 *   Split on FIRST '=' only; everything before is the ID, everything after is
 *   the value (up to the closing backtick).
 *
 *   Skip:
 *     - Fenced code blocks: ``` or ~~~, fence-length- and fence-char-aware
 *       (a longer fence containing a shorter same-char fence line stays a
 *       single skipped region; mismatched-char lines are fence content, not
 *       a toggle)
 *     - HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`), including multi-line
 *     - Prose lines (headings, blank lines, list items without a predicate)
 *     - Blockquote lines (session-log preamble, etc.)
 *
 * Fence-length-awareness note: `src/markdown-sectionizer.cts`'s
 * `stripFencedCode` is the repo's canonical CommonMark fence-stripper, but its
 * `StripFencedResult.text` DROPS fence delimiter and content lines from the
 * output — it does not preserve original line numbers. This parser reports
 * `Predicate.line`/`Malformed.line` as 1-based SOURCE line numbers, which
 * callers assert on — so line-accurate skip detection is required, and
 * `stripFencedCode` cannot serve it directly.
 *
 * Comment/fence precedence (DEFECT.CONTEXT-PREDICATES-COMMENT-FENCE-BLIND,
 * #2928 review): `computeSkippedLineFlags` previously ran the HTML-comment
 * scan and a delegated call to `markdown-sectionizer.cts`'s exported
 * `scanFencedBlocks` seam as two INDEPENDENT passes over the raw lines. That
 * is unsound: `scanFencedBlocks` is comment-blind, so a fence delimiter
 * appearing INSIDE an HTML comment (with no later matching close in the
 * file) was treated as a real *unterminated* fence — silently skipping every
 * remaining line to EOF and permanently dropping later predicates. The
 * converse is also unsound the other way: a bare two-pass ordering that
 * resolves comments first and only then masks-and-rescans for fences
 * mis-handles a `<!--`/`-->` token that appears *inside a genuine fenced
 * block* (proven while fixing this: guarding the comment pass by a
 * comment-blind fence pass, or vice versa, always breaks one of the two
 * directions — the two constructs must suppress each other's
 * open/close detection while active, which only a single interleaved
 * left-to-right pass can guarantee).
 *
 * Chosen precedence (documented per the review's requirement): the two
 * constructs are scanned in ONE forward pass with two mutually-exclusive
 * states, `fence: {char,len} | null` and `inHtmlComment: boolean`.
 *   - While a fence is open, only a fence-close delimiter (same char, run
 *     length >= the opener's) can close it; any `<!--`/`-->` token on a
 *     fenced-content line is fence content, never a comment boundary.
 *   - While NEITHER is open and an HTML comment opens, only a `-->` token
 *     can close it; any fence delimiter seen while inside a comment is
 *     comment content, never a fence boundary.
 *   - When neither is open, a comment opener (`<!--`) is checked BEFORE a
 *     fence opener on the same line — HTML comments are lexically outermost
 *     in this document's grammar — so a fence-shaped info string that
 *     happens to also look like `<!--...-->` never spuriously opens/closes
 *     anything once the line has already been claimed as a fence opener (the
 *     inverse: a genuine one-line comment `<!-- ``` -->` is masked whole and
 *     never interpreted as a fence delimiter).
 * This single-pass design reuses `markdown-sectionizer.cts`'s exact
 * delimiter-matching rule (same regex, same `len >= open.len` /
 * mismatched-char-is-content / backtick-info-string-cannot-contain-backtick
 * semantics as `scanFencedBlocks`), so non-comment-interacting documents are
 * byte-for-byte identical to delegating to `scanFencedBlocks` (see
 * `tests/context-predicates.test.cjs`'s fence-skip parity suite) — the
 * interleaving is required ONLY to resolve the comment/fence interaction,
 * not to change fence semantics themselves. This is therefore a second,
 * necessarily local copy of the (tiny) delimiter-match condition — the
 * scanFencedBlocks seam cannot serve both scans at once, because the correct
 * boundary decision for either construct depends on the OTHER construct's
 * live state at that exact line, not just on a static, comment-blind
 * pre-scan of the raw lines.
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: compiled by tsc to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/context-predicates.cjs (gitignored).

// ID grammar, validated STRUCTURALLY rather than by a single regex
// (DEFECT.CONTEXT-PREDICATES-ID-REDOS, #2928 review). The formerly-used regex
// `^([A-Z][A-Z0-9_-]*(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+)*)=(.+)$` is exponential: the
// group `(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+)*` is ambiguous because its own character
// class contains `.`, so N consecutive dots have exponentially many
// backtick-partitionings for the regex engine to try on a failed match
// (measured: ~565ms for 40 consecutive dots, doubling roughly every 5).
// `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `lint:ci` -> `lint:generated-sync` ->
// `gen-context-index.cjs --check` on `pull_request`, which parses the PR's
// own CONTEXT.md — so any external contributor could hang the shared CI
// runner with one crafted line, no write access required.
//
// Fix: split the candidate id on '.' and validate each segment with a
// simple, non-backtracking, per-segment pattern — linear in id length, no
// ambiguous quantifier. First segment (CLASS) must start with an uppercase
// letter; subsequent segments may start with letter/digit and include
// hyphens/underscores. We intentionally allow lowercase-starting
// sub-segments (e.g. PRED.k320.rule).
//
// Behavior change vs. the old regex: an EMPTY segment (a doubled dot, e.g.
// `A..b`) now REJECTS — the old regex accepted it because `.` was inside the
// subsequent-segment character class, so `.` itself could satisfy
// `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+` with a single character. The real repo CONTEXT.md was
// checked (`grep -nE '\`[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*\.\.[A-Za-z0-9_.-]*='
// CONTEXT.md`) and contains ZERO ids with a doubled dot, so rejecting the
// empty-segment case is the correct, stricter grammar with no behavior loss
// against real data (pinned by a dedicated test below).
