/**
 * Reviewer Lane Runner (ADR-2782 Phase 5b, #2799).
 *
 * Executes an invocation plan from `review-lane-invocation.cts`: probes the lane, spawns the binary
 * or calls the HTTP endpoint, applies the empty-output policy, and dispatches the three first-party
 * handlers D6 names. This is the module that replaces ~640 lines of hand-authored per-CLI bash.
 *
 * THREE RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES DISAPPEAR HERE, and that is a correctness win rather than a tidy-up:
 *   - `jq` — five legs needed it on PATH; it is absent on stock Windows/Git-Bash (#2589). Parsing is
 *     `JSON.parse` now.
 *   - `curl` — the three OpenAI-compatible legs shelled out to it. Node's `fetch` replaces it, and
 *     the raw response body (where an OpenAI-compatible server puts its error JSON on a 4xx/5xx
 *     while curl still exits 0) is no longer discarded by a pipe.
 *   - external `timeout` / `gtimeout` — the Antigravity leg probed for one because
 *     `--print-timeout` cannot fire before a session exists, and STOCK MACOS SHIPS NEITHER, so on a
 *     stock Mac that leg ran unbounded. `spawnSync`'s native `timeout` is always available, so D7's
 *     "skip the probe where no bounding mechanism exists" carve-out is no longer needed.
 *
 * EVERY subprocess call in this file passes `timeout` + `killSignal` + `maxBuffer`. This repo has a
 * named `DEFECT.UNBOUNDED-SUBPROCESS` class (`CONTEXT.md:772`) and an unbounded sync spawn is not a
 * slow test, it is a hung one: `--test-force-exit` cannot interrupt a synchronous call, so a frozen
 * spawn hangs the whole CI chunk to its 10-minute kill with `# fail 0` and no `not ok` (#2099).
 *
 * TOTAL. No function here throws for a lane-level failure; every one returns a typed outcome. A
 * reviewer lane that cannot run must produce a diagnosable artifact, because the ambiguity between
 * "failed" and "ran cleanly with nothing to report" IS the defect this epic closes (#2494/#2605).
