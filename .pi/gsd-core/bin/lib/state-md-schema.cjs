/**
 * STATE.md Field Schema — the one declaration (ADR-3473 §8.8, issue #3873).
 *
 * Phase 3 substrate. Before this module, "which STATE.md keys exist and what
 * they carry" was declared in THREE hand-maintained places that were already
 * observed to disagree (see the `last_activity` docstring below):
 *
 *   - `FIELD_CLASSIFICATION` (`src/state-transition.cts`) — source/preservation/
 *     guard/mergeStrategy per frontmatter key (ADR-1769 §4 / ADR-3408).
 *   - `FRONTMATTER_BODY_SOURCE` (`src/state-transition.cts`) — which BODY field
 *     a frontmatter key derives from.
 *   - `FRONTMATTER_KEY_TO_BODY_LABEL` (`src/state.cts`) — the Title-Case label
 *     a report speaks a preserved field in (ADR-3408 §8.4/§8.5).
 *
 * This module is the single row-per-key declaration those three now PROJECT
 * from at load time (`state-transition.cts` / `state.cts`), rather than
 * hand-maintaining a fourth copy of the same knowledge. Every exported shape
 * of the three original tables is unchanged — same keys, same key ORDER, same
 * frozen/null-prototype-ness — so every existing consumer (the preservation
 * dispatch loop, `getFieldClassification`, `getPreserveWhenUnchangedFields`,
 * `bodyLabelFor`, and issue #3872's `declaredLeavesOf`) keeps working without
 * an edit. See `.gsd/phase/feat-3873-state-md-schema/40-design.md`.
 *
 * LEAF MODULE, DELIBERATELY. This file imports from neither `state-transition.cts`
 * nor `state.cts` — both of those import THIS module, and either importing
 * back would be the exact CJS require-cycle `src/health-diagnostic-types.cts`'s
 * own docstring describes breaking for the health-diagnostic rule tables
 * (`module.exports` read before it is assigned, so a destructured value comes
 * back `undefined`). `FieldSource` / `FieldPreservation` / `FieldGuard` /
 * `FieldMergeStrategy` therefore live HERE now and are re-exported (by the same
 * name, so no importer of `state-transition.cts` needs to change) from
 * `state-transition.cts`.
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: source in `src/state-md-schema.cts`, compiled to
 * `gsd-core/bin/lib/state-md-schema.cjs` (gitignored).
 *
 * Design: .gsd/phase/feat-3873-state-md-schema/40-design.md
 * Test matrix: .gsd/phase/feat-3873-state-md-schema/50-test-matrix.md

/**
 * The seven CANONICAL values `normalizeStateStatus` (`src/state-document.cts`)
 * maps recognized raw status prose TO — the function's default fallback plus
 * each branch's literal output, in the order the function tests them. This is
 * NOT the raw body prose vocabulary `CONTEXT.md`'s "STATE.md Status Lifecycle
 * (ADR-2207)" entry documents (`Ready to plan` → `All phases complete` →
 * `<version> milestone complete` → `Awaiting next milestone`, plus the
 * handler-authored strings in `KNOWN_TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS['Status']`) — that is
 * free-form prose `normalizeStateStatus` READS.
 *
 * CORRECTED (#3873 phase-3 test-matrix row 26 — verified by executing
 * `normalizeStateStatus`, not by reading this docstring's prior claim):
 * this is NOT a closed set the `status` frontmatter key is restricted to at
 * runtime. `normalizeStateStatus` is deliberately LENIENT: its fallback is
 * `normalizedStatus = status || 'unknown'`, and when none of its
 * substring-match branches recognize the raw input, that fallback — the
 * caller's raw, UNRECOGNIZED prose — is returned unchanged. A status value
 * outside this seven-member set is not rejected, coerced, or normalized; it
 * passes straight through into the frontmatter. `STATUS_LIFECYCLE_ENUM` is
 * therefore the set of values the normalizer maps recognized input ONTO, not
 * a runtime-enforced closed vocabulary for the field.

// deliberately: the `FIELD_CLASSIFICATION` projection built from this table
// (`state-transition.cts`) walks `Object.keys(STATE_FIELD_SCHEMA)` directly,
// so this row order IS that projection's key order, and key order is
// observable (the preservation dispatch loop iterates it). The two other
// projections (`FRONTMATTER_BODY_SOURCE`, `FRONTMATTER_KEY_TO_BODY_LABEL`) do
// NOT reuse this same order — their pre-#3873 literals were independently
// hand-written and already disagreed with each other and with this order (see
// each projection's own ordering constant in its home module) — so each
// projection module declares its OWN explicit key-order list rather than
// re-deriving order from this table's iteration, which would silently change
// two of the three tables' observable order out from under every consumer.

        //   - It is ANCHORED. The parser matches `/^(\d+)\s+of\s+(\d+)\s*$/`
        //     against the whole value, so `4 — blocked on review of 2 PRs`
        //     is REJECTED rather than yielding a total of 2 out of prose.
        //     Declaring `'N of M'` is a claim about that grammar, not about
        //     "contains the word of".
        //   - `'N/M'` stays UNDECLARED and must keep failing. Row 23 probes
        //     the undeclared remainder of `SHAPE_EXAMPLES`, so it needs at
        //     least one member outside the declared set to stay non-vacuous.
        //
