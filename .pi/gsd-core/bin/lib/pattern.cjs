/**
 * pattern.cts — the pattern-construction seam (ADR-3212 §1, epic #3212 Phase 1,
 * #3412).
 *
 * Source in src/pattern.cts, compiled to gsd-core/bin/lib/pattern.cjs
 * (gitignored), per the repo's ADR-457 build-at-publish convention.
 *
 * Sole owner of building a `RegExp` from a runtime value. `escapeRegex`
 * delegates to the built-in `RegExp.escape` (ES2026 / Node 24+) when present,
 * falling back to an in-file metacharacter escape below Node 24 (#3498) —
 * still the one owner: no module outside this seam escapes a value for regex
 * use (ADR §1).
 *
 * Counts, corrected during implementation (design doc "Ground truth" #1;
 * .gsd/phase/chore-3412-pattern-seam/40-design.md): the ADR's census counted
 * ~12 *named* helper functions. The shape-based lint guard
 * (eslint-rules/no-adhoc-regex-escape.cjs), which matches the escape-class
 * SHAPE wherever it appears rather than named-function bodies, found 27
 * additional inline copies that census-by-name could not see — **~39 escape
 * sites total**. Call sites follow the same pattern: 17 were surveyed
 * directly, but `src/phase-id.cts`'s `escapeRegex` turned out to have 8
 * external production importers the pre-implementation survey missed, plus
 * the 27 guard-found inline sites also call into the seam — **~44 call
 * sites total**. The lesson worth keeping: a named-function census
 * structurally cannot see an inline `.replace(...)` copy or an
 * externally-imported symbol; only a shape-based guard (or a direct
 * importer graph query) does.
 *
 * `escapeRegex` is the PRIMARY export: the large majority of call sites
 * build a *source string* (alternation via `.map(escapeRegex).join('|')`, or
 * template/concat interpolation into a larger pattern) rather than a
 * standalone literal match. `literalPattern` is the minority convenience
 * wrapper for the remaining "match this value literally" shape — not the
 * dominant one (design doc "Ground truth" #2).
 *
 * Behavior-preserving for MATCH RESULTS, not for pattern TEXT: `RegExp.escape`
 * hex-escapes the leading character of nearly every non-empty input (and `-`,
 * space, and control characters throughout), so the escaped source string
 * differs from the twelve deleted copies' output for almost every value.
 * Match behavior against that source is unaffected — verified by the
 * migration-equivalence property sweep in tests/pattern.test.cjs (rows 15-17).

 * detected by a heuristic scan of the pattern text.
 *
 * Never throws. A pattern that is empty, too long, or not valid RE2 syntax
 * (backreferences and look-around are unsupported by RE2 — those are exactly
 * the constructs that require backtracking) is REFUSED: `test()` always
 * returns `false`, and `neutralized` reports why so callers can surface the
 * refusal (#3477 follow-up: a neutralized pattern must not look like a plain

 * with RE2's linear-time guarantee — a refused pattern is never re-attempted
 * as a literal-escaped match, since guessing at a pattern we could not
 * compile is what produced the prior false-pass regression.
 *
 * `pattern` is `unknown`, not `string`, because callers pull this straight off
 * parsed plan frontmatter (untrusted YAML) — a non-string value must reach the
 * `'empty'`/never-match branch rather than being force-cast by the caller.
