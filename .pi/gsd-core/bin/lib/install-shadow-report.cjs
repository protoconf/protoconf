/**
 * install-shadow-report.cts — Cross-Scope Shadow Report Module (#2873, epic
 * #2866 Phase 4a — governed by
 * `.gsd/phase/feat-2873-cross-scope-shadowing/40-design.md`).
 *
 * A read-only PROJECTION over `resolveInstalledSurfaces`
 * (`installed-surface-resolver.cts`, #2872 Phase 3). That module answers
 * "what is installed"; it is documented there as read-only, and rendering
 * plus sanitization are a different concern with a different consumer set
 * (installer + `/gsd-health`) — the design doc's "Rejected" #5 is why this is
 * a separate leaf module rather than a second export bolted onto the
 * resolver.
 *
 * ── What "shadowed" means here ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A trigger is shadowed when `resolveTriggerSurface` (via the resolver)
 * recorded a non-null `shadowedBy` for it: two scopes both installed a
 * trigger-bearing artifact under the SAME trigger name, and only one wins.
 * For claude (`skills`@global vs `commands`@local) the KINDS differ, so the
 * loser's entire spec tree becomes unreachable through the trigger — the bug
 * #2218 diagnosed. For the 12 both-scopes-`skills` runtimes the kinds are the
 * SAME on both sides, so the loser is merely overridden, not vanished
 * (design row #5 / "Not-corruption"). `kindsDiffer` on `ShadowReport` is what
 * lets `renderShadowReport` word the two cases correctly.
 *
 * ── Report, don't correct (mirrors the resolver's own law) ─────────────────
 * `mismatches` surfaces a declared runtime/scope that disagrees with the
 * probed one (Postel's Law, design doc: liberal in what is accepted, but the
 * mismatch is never silently absorbed). This module never substitutes a
 * declared value for a probed one; it only reports the disagreement the
 * resolver already computed.
 *
 * ── Sanitize at the render seam ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `declaredRuntime` is attacker-influenceable (it comes from a manifest that
 * may live inside a merely-cloned repository) and length-bounded but
 * deliberately NOT charset-gated by the reader (`declaredRuntimeMatchesProbe`
 * needs the raw value there). THIS module is what renders it to an operator,
 * so this module owns the guard — `sanitizeForRender` strips ANSI escapes,
 * C0/C1 controls, and Unicode bidi overrides/isolates, then collapses
 * whitespace. It never truncates: `readInstallManifest` already caps at 64
 * chars, and a second truncation here would double-truncate.
 *
 * Trigger names, by contrast, are already `SAFE_STEM`-gated upstream
 * (`installed-surface-resolver.cts`'s `deriveStemsForKindEntry`) before they
 * ever reach a `TriggerSurface` — this module does not re-gate them.
 *
 * ── Per-scope truth filter (why this lives HERE, not in the resolver) ──────
 * `resolveOneRuntime` (`installed-surface-resolver.cts`) builds ONE union of
 * every installed scope's `stems` and hands that single list to
 * `resolveTriggerSurface`, which then synthesizes a candidate trigger for
 * EVERY stem at EVERY installed scope's trigger-bearing kind entry —
 * regardless of whether that specific scope's own manifest actually shipped
 * that stem. Concretely: a global `full`-profile install (stems a, b, c)
 * alongside a local `core`-profile install (stem a only) unions to
 * `{a, b, c}`, and `resolveTriggerSurface` then reports `commands@local`
 * candidates for b and c too — trigger names for artifacts that do not exist
 * on disk at that scope. Left unfiltered, this module would tell the user
 * `/gsd-b` and `/gsd-c` are shadowed local commands when there is no local
 * artifact for either at all — over-reporting that is not cosmetic, since
 * the whole point of this report is to make a real failure legible.
 *
 * `resolveTriggerSurface`'s API takes ONE stem list shared by every scope it
 * is asked about, so per-scope truth cannot be expressed through it without
 * either widening a shipped Phase-2 contract other callers may depend on, or
 * calling it once per scope and re-implementing its winner computation
 * (`isHigherPriority`) here as a second, driftable copy. `resolveOneRuntime`
 * / `resolveInstalledSurfaces` (Phase 3, #2872) is likewise a shipped module
 * this task deliberately leaves untouched. This module already receives the
 * full `InstalledRuntimeSurface`, including each scope's own REAL `stems`
 * list (`installed-surface-resolver.cts`'s `deriveStemsFromManifest`) — so
 * the correction belongs here, as a filter over `resolveTriggerSurface`'s
 * already-computed `shadowedBy` groups: a trigger is reported as shadowed
 * only when its underlying stem is present in BOTH the winner's scope's own
 * `stems` AND the shadowed side's scope's own `stems` — i.e. an artifact
 * genuinely exists at both scopes, not merely "some stem exists somewhere in
 * the union".
 *
 * `TriggerSurface` does not carry the originating stem OR the composing
 * prefix on its output — only the already-composed `trigger` string
 * (`${prefix}${stem}`) — so the stem cannot be read off it directly. Rather
 * than hand-roll a fixed-offset `trigger.slice(4)` (which would silently
 * assume every runtime's prefix is exactly `gsd-` — true today, but not a
 * contract this module owns), the prefix is recovered the honest way: by
 * re-resolving that scope's `ArtifactKind` layout (`resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout`
 * / `resolveRuntimeArtifactLayoutFromRegistry`, the SAME layout descriptor
 * `resolveTriggerSurface` itself reads its `entry.prefix` from) for the
 * winner's and shadowed side's own `(scope, kind)`, and reading `.prefix`
 * off the matching kind entry. This is metadata-only (constructing an
 * `ArtifactKind` never touches the filesystem — see
 * `runtime-artifact-layout.cts`'s kind-builder functions), so it costs
 * nothing beyond a small per-`(scope,kind)` memo. If a prefix cannot be
 * resolved at all (a `TypeError` from an unexpected registry shape), the
 * trigger is conservatively DROPPED rather than kept — the same
 * report-nothing-you-cannot-prove posture as the rest of this filter.
 *
 * ── Pure with respect to caller-visible state ───────────────────────────────
 * `buildShadowReport` builds a fresh `ShadowReport` (fresh arrays, fresh
 * objects) on every call, exactly as the resolver documents for itself
 * (`installed-surface-resolver.cts`'s "Pure with respect to caller-visible
 * state" paragraph) — no shared or cached state between calls.
