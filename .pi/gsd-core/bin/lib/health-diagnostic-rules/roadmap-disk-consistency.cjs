/**
 * Health Diagnostic — ROADMAP/disk consistency rules (Phase 11, #3309,
 * ADR-3180 §8.2/§8.3/§8.5).
 *
 * Group: "ROADMAP/disk consistency" (design doc, "Rule table organization"
 * table) — W006, W007.
 *
 * Ported behavior-preserving from `cmdValidateHealth`
 * (`src/verify.cts:2029-2101`, the exact call sites for W006/W007).
 *
 * Both rules share ONE matcher — `matchPhaseDirs` + `normalizePhaseName`
 * (`src/phase-id.cts`), the same canonical directory-resolution owner
 * `verify.cts:2060/2073` already calls (its own #2528 comment explains why:
 * pairing roadmap phases against disk by intersecting independently-derived
 * TOKEN SETS mislabels digit-leading slugs like `05-80-20-cleanup` in BOTH
 * directions at once — phase 5 reads as missing a directory (W006) AND that
 * directory reads as not in the roadmap (W007) — so both rules here resolve
 * through `matchPhaseDirs`, never a hand-rolled string/token comparison, and
 * `dirsForPhase` below is the single call site both go through, so they
 * cannot independently drift on what "matches" means (#2528's own bug
 * class).
 *
 * DISK-SIDE SOURCE — `allPhaseDirNames`, NOT `phaseDirs` (found while
 * implementing this file, fixed inline rather than deferred).
 * `snapshot.phaseDirs` (Phase 10, `listMilestonePhaseDirs`) is WINDOWED: its
 * `inWindow` filter (`getMilestonePhaseFilter`, `src/roadmap-parser.cts:1220`)
 * admits a directory only when its phase id is a MEMBER of the roadmap's
 * current-milestone-declared phase set (`isDirInMilestone`). That makes
 * `phaseDirs.value` a subset that, by construction, can never contain a
 * directory the roadmap does NOT declare — exactly the directory W007 exists
 * to find. Sourced from `phaseDirs`, W007 would be structurally inert: every
 * member of the set is already provably claimable. Verified empirically
 * (`node -e` trace against a real `buildPlanningSnapshot`): a genuine orphan
 * directory (`04-extra`, no roadmap entry) was silently absent from
 * `phaseDirs.value` and W007 fired zero diagnostics. `phaseDirs`'s windowing
 * also risks a W006 false positive for a phase declared in a NON-current
 * milestone section (`roadmapDeclaredPhases` is built from the FULL raw
 * ROADMAP, all milestones — `src/planning-snapshot.cts:398-436` — while
 * `phaseDirs` is scoped to the current milestone only), so both rules here
 * use the new, additive `allPhaseDirNames` field
 * (`src/planning-snapshot.cts`) instead: every directory actually present
 * under the active `phases/` root, unfiltered by roadmap declaration.
 * Archived-milestone directory names (`verify.cts:2050`,
 * `collectArchivedPhaseDirNames`) are still not exposed as directory NAMES
 * on `PlanningSnapshot`, but the equivalent TOKEN set is: `checkW006` below
 * additionally consults `snapshot.archivedPhaseTokens` (added for the
 * W002/state-consistency group's #3652 fix, reused verbatim here — see that
 * field's own doc comment) so a phase whose only directory lives in a
 * milestone archive (shipped OR the current milestone's own archive layout)
 * no longer reads as W006-missing (Bug 1, found post-migration: the archived
 * fixtures under `tests/milestone-archive.test.cjs` and
 * `tests/verify-health.test.cjs` regressed against the pre-migration
 * `verify.cts` behavior). W007 still never scans archived dirs (its loop is
 * `allPhaseDirNames.value`, the active `phases/` root only), so an archived
 * dir still cannot spuriously read as W007-orphaned either — unchanged.
 *
 * Bug 2 (found alongside Bug 1): `dirsForPhase` below also runs a
 * `phaseVariants()`-based fallback when `matchPhaseDirs` finds nothing — see
 * its own doc comment. Pre-migration, `verify.cts:2071-2073`/`2092-2093` ran
 * this as a SECOND, independent check the migrated matchPhaseDirs-only path
 * had dropped, causing a false W006/W007 whenever ROADMAP and disk spelled
 * the same phase with a different zero-padding (e.g. ROADMAP "01A" vs disk
 * "1A-...").
 *
 * Not-started exclusion (verify.cts:2065/2075-2076,
 * `buildNotStartedPhaseVariants`, `src/validate.cts:160`): the design doc's
 * field table assigns this group only `roadmapDeclaredPhases`/`phaseDirs`,
 * and `roadmapDeclaredPhases` (`src/planning-snapshot.cts:398-436`) does
 * NOT filter not-started phases out — it returns every heading- and
 * checklist-declared phase id regardless of checked state (confirmed by
 * direct read: its `buildRoadmapPhaseVariants` call includes BOTH `[x]` and
 * `[ ]` checklist entries). Omitting the exclusion here would regress a
 * COMMON case: `gsd-core/templates/roadmap.md`'s "Initial Roadmap" shape
 * declares every phase as an unchecked `- [ ] **Phase N: [Name]**` checklist
 * item before any phase directory exists, so a freshly created ROADMAP.md
 * would immediately spam one W006 per phase. `snapshot.roadmapPhaseCheckboxes`
 * (`src/planning-snapshot.cts:457-480`, backs W011 in the STATE.md-consistency
 * group) already parses exactly this `[x]`/`[ ]` state — `check(snapshot)`'s
 * signature grants the full snapshot, not just this group's assigned column,
 * so `isPhaseNotStarted` below reads it directly rather than re-deriving a
 * third independent regex over raw ROADMAP text (forbidden by §8.1 rule 2).
 * KNOWN GAP, disclosed rather than silently dropped: `roadmapPhaseCheckboxes`
 * is keyed by `PHASE_NUMBER_TOKEN_SOURCE` (`phase-id.cts:54`, no dash), so a
 * milestone-dash-prefixed phase id ("2-01") can never match a checkbox key —
 * unlike the original `buildNotStartedPhaseVariants`, which captures the
 * fuller `[\w][\w.-]*` grammar (dashes included). For that id shape only,
 * this rule's not-started exclusion silently no-ops (never excludes), which
 * is the conservative direction (a possible false W006, not a suppressed
 * true one).
 *
 * Design: .gsd/phase/refactor-3309-health-diagnostic-rule-table/40-design.md
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: source in
 * src/health-diagnostic-rules/roadmap-disk-consistency.cts, compiled to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/health-diagnostic-rules/roadmap-disk-consistency.cjs
 * (gitignored).
