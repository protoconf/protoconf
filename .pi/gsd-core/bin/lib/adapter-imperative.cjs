/**
 * Imperative embedding adapter (ADR-1239 Phase C-1, AC2 / #1680).
 *
 * The engine-as-library path: an in-process host plugin calls
 * `createImperativeAdapter({runtime})`, which composes the capability registry
 * via `loadRegistry({includeInstalled:true})` (first-party-wins + consent +
 * fail-closed gates) and binds the engine surface behind the SAME
 * `HostIntegrationInterface` the declarative adapter satisfies. The adapter
 * stays thin — it does NOT reimplement the loop resolver; it delegates to the
 * engine + exposes the composed registry so a host (Phase 5) can bind its
 * primitives (command/dispatch/model/hooks/state/artifact) to the registry's
 * declared capability set.
 *
 * Concrete host binding (OpenCode/VS Code/pi) is deferred to Phase 5 (#1682,
 * D15/D18). This slice ships the adapter + the composed-registry seam.
 *
 * Minimal interface (per ADR-1239 open wire-shape question): satisfies the
 * same `{kind, runtime, install, uninstall}` shape as the declarative adapter,
 * plus an imperative-specific `registry` accessor (the composed loadRegistry
 * result). The full 6-point binding surface grows when a real host consumer
 * fixes the shape.
