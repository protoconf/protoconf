    # opener line and blocked. When the quote is not followed by whitespace or
    # the end of the command, skip the resolver and keep the pre-fix subject
    # (first captured line): the heredoc form then fails the format gate
    # exactly as it did on base, and the plain single-line form keeps base
    # behavior unchanged. The guard is tested against the arm that MATCHED,

      # EMULATE what bash does to an argument before git sees it -- round 6
      # removed quotes, round 7 backslashes, round 8 the `$` of a dollar-quote,
      # and each time review found another transform that had been missed. Round
      # 9 found four more, all measured accepting `WIP` as the real subject on
      # bash 3.2.57 and 5.3.15 while the plain spelling of the same command is
      # refused:
      #
      #     -$'\155' WIP        ANSI-C octal escape decodes to `m`
      #     -$'\x6d' WIP        ANSI-C hex escape decodes to `m`
      #     -`printf m` WIP     command substitution, backtick spelling
      #     x= … -${x}m WIP     parameter expansion
      #     -? WIP              pathname expansion, with a file named `-m`
      #
      # The last two settle the strategy: an option name finished by a PARAMETER
      # expansion depends on a variable's runtime value, and one finished by a
      # PATHNAME expansion depends on the contents of the working directory.
      # Neither is derivable from the command string at any level of effort, so
      # emulation cannot be completed -- not "has not been completed yet".
      #
      # So the rule is no longer "normalise it and match the literal". It is: an
      # option NAME containing a shell expansion or quoting construct is
      # UNRESOLVABLE, and unresolvable refuses. One rule covers every spelling
      # above, and every spelling nobody has thought of yet, in the fail-closed
      # direction. The dequoting passes above are kept: they still normalise the
      # deterministic removals so the guards RECOGNISE `--clean""up=` and `-\m`
      # rather than merely refusing them, which keeps the existing rows honest.
      #
      # SCOPED TO THE NAME, NOT THE VALUE, exactly as before: the class is a
      # `-`-leading token whose characters up to the substitution contain no `=`.

      # NEWLINE IS A COMMAND SEPARATOR TOO (independent review of #3816, round
      # 7) — the test above. The separator scan covered `;`, `&` and `|` but not
      # a literal newline, so a LATER command's heredoc-shaped `-m` was taken
      # for this commit's message:
      #
      #     git commit --amend --no-edit
      #     echo -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
      #     fix: conforming text unrelated to the commit
      #     EOF
      #     )"
      #
      # The classifier recognises the leading commit, the capture reaches across
      # the newline into `echo`'s argument, and a conforming string with no
      # relationship to the commit was validated and allowed. Tested as a glob
      # rather than folded into the bracket class, because a literal newline
      # inside a bash regex bracket expression is not portably expressible.

      # CLEANUP-MODE GUARD (Codex review of #3816, round 4 — BLOCKER). The
      # resolver skips leading blank lines and strips trailing whitespace
      # because git's DEFAULT cleanup=whitespace does. Under
      # `--cleanup=verbatim` git does neither, so a 72-char subject plus three
      # trailing spaces is committed as a 75-byte subject while the hook
      # measured 72 — COMMIT_SUBJECT_TOO_LONG dodged (measured base=2 -> head=0;
      # confirmed by reading the raw commit object, since `git log --pretty=%s`
      # strips trailing whitespace in its own output and hides it).
      # Any named mode other than `whitespace` refuses. A mode set persistently
      # in git config is invisible here and stays a documented residual limit.
      # SCOPE (review of #3816, round 5 — BLOCKER). This scan must exclude the
      # message. `--cleanup=` and `commit.cleanup=` are ordinary English inside
      # a commit message — this repository's own hooks and docs discuss them
      # constantly — and the heredoc BODY sits verbatim inside $CMD, so
      # scanning $CMD refused to resolve any conforming message that merely
      # MENTIONED the token, blocking it with CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS_VIOLATION.
      # Scanning $MSG_PREFIX alone (the fix as first prescribed) would reopen
      # the bypass this guard exists for: git accepts the flag on either side
      # of -m, and `git commit -m "<heredoc>" --cleanup=verbatim` is caught
      # today only because the scan is command-wide. PREFIX + SUFFIX keeps both
      # positions covered while excluding the one span that is message text.
      # The two are joined with a space so a token cannot be forged across the
      # seam out of a prefix tail and a suffix head.
      # KNOWN LIMIT, deliberately fail-closed (#3816, round 6). This window is
      # the whole command minus the message, so a `--cleanup=` that belongs to a
      # DIFFERENT command — `git commit -m "<heredoc>" && echo --cleanup=verbatim`
      # — also refuses, and a conforming commit git would accept stays blocked.
      # Narrowing it to git's own segment was tried and reverted: deciding where
      # git's command ends needs a shell parse, and a substring scan is not one.
      # Trimming at the first `;&|` cut the window short whenever a separator sat
      # inside an ordinary argument — `--author "a&b"`, and equally `--author
      # a\&b` — which hid a REAL trailing `--cleanup=verbatim` and ACCEPTED a
      # 75-byte subject the length gate had measured as 72. Two successive
      # narrowings each reopened that hole on a shape the previous one missed, so
      # the scan stays wide: refusing a commit git would take is recoverable,
      # accepting an over-long subject is not.
      # ABBREVIATIONS (independent review of #3816, round 6). git accepts any
      # unambiguous prefix of a long option, so `--cle=verbatim` sets the mode
      # while matching no literal `--cleanup` — measured accepting a 75-byte
      # subject recorded as 72. The class is deliberately wider than git's own
      # abbreviation set: over-matching only refuses more, which is the safe
      # direction, and no other `--cl` option exists for git commit.
      # LAST DIRECTIVE WINS, AND ONE MATCH CANNOT SEE IT (independent review of
      # #3816, round 7). A bash regex yields ONE BASH_REMATCH, so only the
      # FIRST cleanup directive was inspected — and git applies the LAST one.
      # `--cleanup=whitespace -m <heredoc> --cleanup=verbatim` therefore read as
      # mode=whitespace, resolution stayed enabled, and a 72-character subject
      # plus trailing spaces was accepted while git recorded 75 bytes with the
      # whitespace preserved (confirmed against the raw commit object). Deciding
      # WHICH directive is last needs an argv order this substring scan does not
      # have, so multiplicity itself refuses: more than one directive is
      # unresolvable, not "probably fine". Single-directive behaviour is
      # unchanged.
