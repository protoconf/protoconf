/**
 * Installer migration: retire pi's legacy `<piConfigDir>/hooks/` directory
 * after GSD's shared hook bundle moved to `<piConfigDir>/gsd-hooks/` (#3023).
 *
 * What old artifact is being retired?
 *   `hooks/` (and its `hooks/lib/` subdirectory) at the pi config root. pi
 *   reserves that exact name as its own deprecated extension directory and
 *   warns on every startup whenever it exists — pi's
 *   `checkDeprecatedExtensionDirs()` fires on mere PATH EXISTENCE, not on the
 *   directory having contents (unlike the sibling `tools/` check, which does
 *   `readdir` first). GSD used to install its shared hook bundle at exactly
 *   that reserved path, so every pi install carried the warning permanently.
 *   The fix moved the install target to `gsd-hooks/`
 *   (`hostBehaviors.sharedHooksDirName`), but an EXISTING install that
 *   upgrades still has the old `hooks/` tree sitting on disk — nothing
 *   removes it on its own, so the warning would persist forever without this
 *   migration.
 *
 * How do we prove it is GSD-owned?
 *   Per file, by manifest membership — the same `classifyArtifact()` check
 *   every other migration in this directory uses. Pre-#3023 pi installs
 *   record the shared hook bundle under `hooks/…` keys in
 *   `gsd-file-manifest.json`; the new install target writes `gsd-hooks/…`
 *   keys instead, which this migration structurally never sees because it
 *   only ever walks the `hooks/` subtree.
 *
 * What happens if the user modified it?
 *   `backup-and-remove` instead of `remove-managed`, so a locally patched
 *   hook script is recoverable from the backup rather than silently
 *   destroyed — mirrors migration 006.
 *
 * What happens to files the manifest never recorded?
 *   Nothing. An unmanifested file under `hooks/` (classification `unknown`)
 *   is left exactly where it is, and — because its presence keeps the
 *   directory non-empty — it also keeps the directory itself from being
 *   retired. That is a deliberate consequence of directory removal being
 *   gated on emptiness, not a special case.
 *
 * What happens to the directory itself?
 *   `hooks/lib/` and then `hooks/` each get a `remove-empty-dir` action (see
 *   `evaluateRemoveEmptyDir` in `../installer-migrations.cts`). That action
 *   only ever calls `fs.rmdirSync` — never a recursive removal — and
 *   re-checks emptiness immediately before doing so, so a directory that
 *   still holds anything (an unmanifested file, or a file-level action that
 *   failed to apply) is left in place rather than assumed empty. Actions are
 *   emitted deepest-first (`hooks/lib` before `hooks`) so the parent has a
 *   chance to become empty in the same pass.
 *
 * What happens if it is missing?
 *   No actions. A fresh post-#3023 pi install never creates `hooks/` at all,
 *   and an already-migrated install has nothing left to retire — both plan
 *   empty, so the migration is idempotent.
 *
 * What runtime and scope does it affect?
 *   pi only, global and local. No other runtime's install is affected:
 *   `hostBehaviors.sharedHooksDirName` defaults to `'hooks'` for every other
 *   runtime, and none of them reserve that name the way pi does, so a
 *   claude/kimi/opencode/etc. `hooks/` directory is a live, in-use install
 *   surface that must never be touched here. The runtime check is the FIRST
 *   thing `plan()` does, ahead of even checking whether the directory exists,
 *   as defense in depth beyond the `runtimes: ['pi']` record-level filter the
 *   framework itself already enforces.
 *
 * Is the action safe in non-interactive install?
 *   Yes. Every emitted action type (`remove-managed`, `backup-and-remove`,
 *   `remove-empty-dir`) is non-interactive and journaled; none requires a
 *   user choice, and unknown files never produce an action.
 *
 * See docs/installer-migrations.md#shipped-migrations, the pi row of
 * docs/installer-migrations.md#runtime-configuration-contract-registry, and
 * the 2026-08-07 amendment to docs/adr/0008-installer-migration-module.md.
