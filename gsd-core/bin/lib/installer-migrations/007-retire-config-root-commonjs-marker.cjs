/**
 * Installer migration: retire the config-root `{"type":"commonjs"}` marker that
 * pre-#2544 installs wrote over `<configRoot>/package.json`.
 *
 * What old artifact is being retired?
 *   `package.json` at the runtime config root. Before #2544,
 *   `installSharedHooksBundle(destRootDir)` wrote `{"type":"commonjs"}` there
 *   unconditionally on every install and every re-install, to pin GSD's staged
 *   `.js` hook scripts to CommonJS via Node's ancestor walk. #2544 moved that
 *   marker into the directories GSD actually fills (`hooks/`, and the
 *   `nativePlugin.dir` for runtimes declaring one) and stopped writing the
 *   config root at all. Without this migration an upgrader keeps BOTH markers:
 *   the new one under `hooks/` and the stale one at the root, so the config
 *   root stays pinned to CommonJS and the PR's own claim — that GSD no longer
 *   writes the shared config root — is false for every install made since the
 *   marker was introduced, until the user uninstalls.
 *
 * How do we prove it is GSD-owned?
 *   By exact content match, NOT by the manifest. The config-root marker was
 *   never recorded in `gsd-file-manifest.json` — `writeManifest()` records
 *   `hooks/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `scripts/`, and the native plugin, and
 *   has never had a `manifest.files['package.json']` entry — so
 *   `classifyArtifact('package.json')` answers `unknown` and the planner's
 *   own guard would downgrade a `remove-managed` to `preserve-user`.
 *   This migration therefore supplies the "purpose-built detector for an old
 *   GSD-owned shape" that `docs/installer-migrations.md#remove-managed`
 *   sanctions, and declares the resulting classification on the action: the
 *   file is removed only when its bytes are exactly the marker GSD writes
 *   (`{"type":"commonjs"}`, trailing whitespace tolerated). That is the same
 *   predicate `removeCommonJsMarker` has always used on the uninstall side, so
 *   install, uninstall, and migration cannot drift apart.
 *
 * What happens if the user modified it?
 *   Then it is not the marker, and this migration does not touch it. Any
 *   `package.json` carrying a `name`, `dependencies`, `scripts`, or any key
 *   beyond the single `type` — i.e. every file the #2544 defect destroyed —
 *   fails the exact-content test and is left exactly as found. There is
 *   deliberately no `backup-and-remove` branch: a modified file here is not a
 *   patched GSD artifact, it is somebody else's file.
 *
 * What happens if it is missing?
 *   No actions. Fresh post-#2544 installs never wrote it, already-migrated
 *   installs no longer have it, and the executor additionally journals a
 *   `missing` outcome if it disappears between plan and apply. Idempotent.
 *
 * What runtime and scope does it affect?
 *   Every runtime whose config root received the marker — i.e. every runtime
 *   not excluded from `installSharedHooksBundle(targetDir)` by
 *   `hostBehaviors.skipSharedHooksInstall` and not Codex: antigravity,
 *   augment, claude, claude-local, codebuddy, hermes, qwen, kilo, opencode,
 *   and pi. The `runtimes` field is OMITTED — the framework's "all runtimes" —
 *   rather than carrying that hand-list: a runtime that never received the
 *   marker simply has no file to match, so enumerating them would add a second
 *   place for the set to drift out of date without changing behavior. Note it
 *   must be omitted and not `[]`; see the field's own comment below.
 *
 *   ONE DELIBERATE CARVE-OUT — kimi. Kimi's marker was written to its native
 *   hook root (`~/.kimi`, `resolveKimiHooksTomlDir`), which is NOT under
 *   kimi's `configDir` (its generic Agent-Skills root). Migration relPaths are
 *   structurally confined to `configDir` (`validateSafeRelPath` /
 *   `ensureInsideConfig`), so this framework cannot address that path at all.
 *   Kimi's stale root marker is retired by the installer instead, at the same
 *   call site that writes its replacement — see the `kimi-hooks-toml` branch
 *   in `bin/install.js`. Named here so the gap is not mistaken for an
 *   oversight.
 *
 * Is the action safe in non-interactive install?
 *   Yes. `remove-managed` is non-interactive and journaled, the executor takes
 *   a rollback snapshot before unlinking, and no branch of this migration can
 *   emit `prompt-user`. A file that is not byte-identical to GSD's marker
 *   produces no action at all.
 *
 * See docs/installer-migrations.md#shipped-migrations and #action-types.
