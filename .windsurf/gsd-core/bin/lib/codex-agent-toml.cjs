/**
 * Codex Agent TOML — typed IR for `~/.codex/agents/<agent>.toml` (#3243, ADR-2313).
 *
 * A genuine leaf: node builtins only. This is a **document model**, not a policy —
 * it knows how to parse/render/strip two known keys (`model`,
 * `model_reasoning_effort`) from a Codex agent `.toml`. It does NOT know which
 * `model` values are illegal for Codex (that predicate — Anthropic-flavored
 * detection — stays in `model-catalog.cts`; callers decide what to strip).
 *
 * Moved here (not copied) from `agent-install-check.cts` (#3242, Phase 2), which
 * wrote the hard half: block-range detection, BOM stripping, TOML value
 * unquoting, and the lenient header scan. That module's behavior is UNCHANGED —
 * it imports `stripBOM`/`scanTomlLines` from here and its regression suite
 * (`tests/agent-install-check.test.cjs`) is the proof.
 *
 * #3897 rung 3 amendment: `deriveCodexSandboxMode`/`CODEX_SANDBOX_HOLDS`/
 * `validateCodexSandboxHolds` also live here now (moved from `bin/install.js`).
 * That IS a policy (which `sandbox_mode` a role's tool contract derives), a
 * narrow exception to this module's "document model, not policy" charter above
 * — made because `bin/install.js` cannot be the shared owner: requiring it for
 * its side effect on `require()` (the CLI banner print) corrupts every
 * stdout-JSON caller (`agent-install-check.cts`'s `checkCodexSandboxPosture`).
 * This module was already the single fs/path-free-parsing home both callers
 * shared; `fs`/`path` are imported below ONLY for `validateCodexSandboxHolds`'s
 * roster check — still node builtins only, no third-party or bin/lib dependency.
 *
 * ── The reconciliation (40-design.md) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase 2's reader and this phase's writer disagree on how to handle an
 * unterminated `developer_instructions` block, deliberately:
 *
 *   - The READER (`scanTomlLines`, used directly by `checkCodexModelPosture`)
 *     stays LENIENT: an unterminated block still excludes "the rest of the
 *     file" from the header scan (findDeveloperInstructionsBlockRange's
 *     existing fallback), because misreading prompt prose as a pin is only a
 *     false positive — it wastes a user's time, nothing more.
 *   - The WRITER (`parseCodexAgentToml`, used by the Codex sync) is STRICT: an
 *     unterminated block makes the whole document `{ok:false}`, because a
 *     writer that proceeds on a malformed document risks rewriting it.
 *
 * One block-range detector, two call sites, two policies — never two detectors
 * that could silently drift from each other.

// introduced): `agent-install-check.cts`'s `checkCodexSandboxPosture` used to
// lazily `require(bin/install.js)` to reach this derivation — but requiring
// `bin/install.js` runs its whole top-level script, including the ASCII
// banner print to stdout, which corrupted every stdout-JSON caller downstream
// of `checkCodexSandboxPosture` (`gsd-tools validate agents`). This module is
// a genuine leaf with no top-level side effects, so both `bin/install.js` and
// `agent-install-check.cts` import the derivation from here instead — ONE
// owner, no second predicate (routing `src/` through `bin/install.js` was
// backwards layering to begin with).
//
// This module does NOT parse frontmatter (there is no third copy of that
// extraction here — two already exist, `bin/install.js` and
// `runtime-artifact-conversion.cts`). `deriveCodexSandboxMode` below takes
// the already-resolved `tools:` value as a plain string parameter: every
// caller already has it (or the raw frontmatter to pull it from) in hand
// before calling in, so this module stays a pure predicate over data
// supplied by the caller — never a document reader itself. This also means
// the module never needs the full YAML-backed `frontmatter.cts` engine
// (vendored js-yaml + anchor/alias refusal + comment-channel plumbing, built
// for a much broader contract than a single `tools:` line lookup) — it has
// no frontmatter-parsing need at all anymore.

 * The 17 roles measured as widening under derivation (declare Write/Edit,

 * `read-only` pending the open question of whether Codex enforces
 * `sandbox_mode` or treats it as advisory (HALT.md). This list is CLOSED and

 * #3897 security review F1/F3 — pipeline, in this exact order:

 *      before anything else runs, so a path-traversal-shaped candidate can
 *      never dodge the hold lookup by hiding behind a directory prefix.
 *   2. trim ASCII whitespace AND the NBSP/zero-width/control-char class
 *      ({@link SANDBOX_IDENTITY_EDGE_RE}) from both ends.
 *   3. strip trailing dots (`gsd-doc-writer.` collapses to the same key).
 *   4. `String.prototype.normalize('NFKC')` — canonicalizes compatibility
 *      variants (e.g. fullwidth `ｇ` U+FF47 folds to ASCII `g`) to their
 *      standard form so a widened-by-Unicode-lookalike name collapses onto
 *      the real held key instead of merely looking similar to it.
 *   5. lowercase — ASCII recasing already matched the hold set before this
 *      rung; this keeps that property after the above steps.
 *
 * Returns `null` (never throws) for a non-string input or when the fully
 * normalized result is empty, so callers can treat `null` as "not a real
 * identity, cannot be held, but see the `suspicious` companion signal".

// `runtime-artifact-conversion.cjs` there just to pull one frontmatter field
// — that module's own dependency chain (`command-roster.cjs` →
// `scripts/fix-slash-commands.cjs`, a dev-only repo script) does not resolve
// from an installed tree, which is exactly what broke

// Scoped to ONLY the `tools:` key: finds the leading `---`-delimited
// frontmatter block and returns its `tools:` value (quotes stripped), or
// `''` when there is no frontmatter block or no `tools:` key at all.
//
// #3897 rung 4/list-form fix: handles BOTH shapes a `tools:` key can take —
// (a) inline: `tools: Read, Write, Edit` on the same line as the key, and
// (b) YAML block-list form: `tools:` alone, followed by indented `- Item`
// lines (`agents/gsd-nyquist-auditor.md`, `agents/gsd-security-auditor.md`
// are the only two roster files using this shape today). The former
// implementation was a single `/^tools:\s*(.+)$/m` regex — `\s*` swallows the
// newline after a bare `tools:` key, so it silently matched into the FIRST
// list item's own line and returned just `"- Read"`, reading a real
// Write/Edit DECLARATION as an absence. List items are joined with `, ` so
// the result feeds {@link _codexToolsDeclareWriteOrEdit}'s comma-tokenizer
// unchanged. The list terminates at the first line that is not an indented
// `- Item` (a new frontmatter key, `---`, a blank line, or EOF) — it never

 *
 * #3897 CAUSE C fix: this function is TOTAL — it never throws, for any
 * (identity, toolsValue) pair. It used to throw when a held role's CONTENT
 * (whatever the caller handed it) did not derive broader than its pin, on
 * the theory that a stale hold should "fail loudly at the point the
 * derivation runs". That reasoning does not survive contact with this
 * function's actual contract: it is a pure predicate over whatever content
 * the caller supplies, and tests legitimately pass synthetic fixtures for
 * held role names, so the throw fired on arbitrary input, not just the real
 * roster. It is also redundant even for real input — if a held role's
 * content does not derive broader, applying the hold pins `read-only` and
 * derivation would return `read-only` anyway; the hold is a no-op, so there
 * is nothing to fail about at derivation time. The STALENESS invariant (S4)
 * is a property of the real `agents/` roster, not of an arbitrary call's
 * input, so it belongs — and stays enforced — only at the roster level: see
 * {@link validateCodexSandboxHolds} and `tests/codex-config.test.cjs`
 * T24/T25, which assert it against the real roster directly.
 *
 * `agentName` here MUST be every identity the content's own frontmatter
 * could disagree with — i.e. the source `.md` FILENAME stem AND (when the
 * caller has one) the frontmatter-derived `name:` display value, passed
 * together as an array. Accepting only one of the two and applying the
 * result to an ARTIFACT keyed on the other is the #3897 security review F1
 * regression this function closes: `bin/install.js`'s emit loop decides
 * `sandbox_mode` for the filename stem but writes the `.toml` at a path keyed
 * on `name`, so a renamed file (stem drifts, `name:` stays pinned) or a
 * sibling file whose `name:` collides with a held role could make the two
 * identities disagree and land a held role's own artifact with
 * `workspace-write`. See {@link isSandboxHeld} for the most-restrictive-wins
 * rule across every candidate identity.
 *
 * `toolsRaw` is the already-resolved `tools:` frontmatter VALUE (e.g.
 * `"Read, Write, Edit"`), not the frontmatter block or the full agent
 * content — see {@link deriveCodexSandboxMode}'s doc for why.
