/**
 * Health Diagnostic — Worktree health rules (Phase 11, #3309, ADR-3180
 * §8.2/§8.3/§8.5).
 *
 * Group: "Worktree health" (design doc, "Rule table organization" table) —
 * W020 (×3 internal conditions, one subject: "the worktree health scan
 * itself is degraded", design doc "Rejected alternatives" §3), W017 (orphan
 * worktree), W027 (NEW — the split-off "stale worktree" subject, design
 * doc's "New codes for the two split subjects" section).
 *
 * Ported behavior-preserving from `cmdValidateHealth`
 * (`src/verify.cts:2193-2268`), the exact call sites for W020/W017/W027 (the
 * pre-migration source still names the split-off stale-worktree site
 * 'W017' — this batch is what actually applies the W027 split).
 *
 * W020's original THREE conditions were git_timed_out / git_list_failed / a
 * per-finding 'unverified' kind, each with its own message. The first two
 * are scan-level failures reported by `inspectWorktreeHealth`'s own `reason`
 * field ('git_timed_out' vs 'git_list_failed' vs 'not_a_git_repo') —
 * `planning-snapshot.cts`'s `buildWorktreeHealthField` now carries `reason`
 * straight through on `PlanningSnapshot.worktreeHealth`, so `checkW020`
 * below reproduces the original's exact branch-per-reason messages instead
 * of collapsing them (a prior version of this file collapsed both into one
 * message AND, worse, warned on 'not_a_git_repo' too — a regression, since
 * the original silently skips a non-git cwd; see `verify.cts:2202-2217`).
 *
 * W027 restores the pre-migration active-worktree exclusion
 * (`verify.cts:2233-2242`) via `PlanningSnapshot.cwd` — see `checkW027`'s own
 * comment below for the mechanism.
 *
 * Design: .gsd/phase/refactor-3309-health-diagnostic-rule-table/40-design.md
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: source in
 * src/health-diagnostic-rules/worktree-health.cts, compiled to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/health-diagnostic-rules/worktree-health.cjs (gitignored).

// a 'stale' finding is skipped when `snapshot.cwd` equals the finding's path
// or is nested under it, the exact comparison `verify.cts:2238-2241` made
// against `process.cwd()`. Per this batch's brief: the interpolated command
// (with the real path) lives in `message`; `remedy.args.command` stays a
// static `<path>` template, mirroring the split the brief specifies.
// ─── #3663 — path-comparison provenance helper ─────────────────────────────
//
// snapshot.cwd is raw process-cwd-derived — path.resolve() normalizes
// separators and relative segments but NOT casing, and a process launched via
// a differently-cased path echoes that spelling back. finding.path is
// `git worktree list`-derived, which self-normalizes to the canonical
// on-disk casing (forward slashes). Comparing those two spellings strictly
// misclassifies the ACTIVE worktree as stale on win32 — so the comparison
// folds case ONLY on win32 (case-insensitive filesystem, via the Shell
// Command Projection seam's toComparablePathKey — the platform-conditional
// fold policy lives there, not per call site) and stays case-sensitive on
// POSIX, where differently-cased paths are genuinely different directories.
// No realpath resolution — that would change symlink matching behavior.
