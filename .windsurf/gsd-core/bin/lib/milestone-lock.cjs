/**
 * Milestone Lock — advisory (phase, session) claim over the single Current
 * Position slot in STATE.md (#3311).
 *
 * Problem it solves: two sessions running DIFFERENT phases in the same working
 * tree both read-modify-write `## Current Position`. The byte-level STATE.md
 * lock (#464) already serializes those writes, so no write is lost — but the
 * SEMANTIC clobber is silent: `state.advance-plan` takes no phase argument and
 * advances whatever plan the (possibly just clobbered) Current Position names,
 * and nothing ever surfaces that two sessions claimed two different phases
 * against the one single-slot field.
 *
 * This module is the maintainer-chosen fix (issue #3311 comment): a milestone
 * lock keyed by phase + session id, with a second session WARNED instead of
 * silently overwriting. It is an advisory claim file, not a mutex:
 *
 * - `.planning/milestone.lock` (workstream-scoped via planningDir) holds
 *   `{ phase, session, pid, updated_at }`.
 * - Session identity reuses `getWorkstreamSessionKey()`
 *   (active-workstream-store.cjs): env-first (GSD_SESSION_KEY,
 *   CLAUDE_SESSION_ID, CODEX_THREAD_ID, …), then the controlling TTY. Two
 *   agent sessions in different terminals/runtimes resolve different keys;
 *   headless runs resolve to null.
 * - Liveness is age-based only: a claim is live while
 *   `now - updated_at < MILESTONE_LOCK_TTL_MS`. There is deliberately NO
 *   pid-liveness gate — CLI invocations are short-lived, so the recorded pid
 *   is dead by the next invocation regardless of whether the agent SESSION is
 *   still active; pid-death would make every claim instantly stale. Active
 *   sessions heartbeat their claim (advance-plan on a matching position
 *   refreshes updated_at); an abandoned claim self-expires after the TTL.
 * - Conflict rule: a live claim for a DIFFERENT phase held by a DIFFERENT
 *   session. Same phase never conflicts (the lock is keyed by phase — two
 *   sessions on one phase are doing the same work). A non-null session key
 *   equal to the caller's never conflicts (one orchestrating session may
 *   re-target its own claim). A null session key never counts as "same" as
 *   anything, so headless parallel phases are still detected. The one
 *   exception is advance-plan (checkMilestonePosition), which reports ANY
 *   live claim/position phase mismatch regardless of session — a session's
 *   own legitimate re-targeting goes through begin-phase, which keeps the
 *   claim in sync, so a same-session mismatch is just as anomalous.
 * - On conflict the existing claim is LEFT INTACT (not stolen): as long as two
 *   phases are concurrently active, every Current Position mutation keeps
 *   reporting the conflict. The conflicting command still proceeds (warn, not
 *   block — a stale-but-live claim must not brick later sessions).
