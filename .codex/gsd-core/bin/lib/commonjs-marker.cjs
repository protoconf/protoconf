/**
 * CommonJS module-type marker — single source of truth (#2544).
 *
 * GSD stages its own hook scripts and native plugin adapters as `.js` files.
 * Node resolves a `.js` file's module type by walking up for the nearest
 * `package.json`, so an ambient `"type": "module"` above the install location
 * makes every one of those scripts fail with `require is not defined`. GSD
 * pins them to CommonJS by writing a minimal `{"type":"commonjs"}` marker.
 *
 * Two rules govern that marker, and this module exists so both are enforced in
 * exactly one place:
 *
 * 1. **Write only where GSD owns the contents.** The marker belongs in the
 *    directories GSD fills with its own `.js` files (`hooks/`, and the
 *    `nativePlugin.dir` for the runtimes that declare one) — never at the
 *    runtime's shared config root, which on OpenCode and Kilo is documented,
 *    user-writable territory for declaring local-plugin npm dependencies.
 *
 * 2. **Never overwrite a file GSD did not write.** Before #2544 the install
 *    path wrote the marker unconditionally while the uninstall path already
 *    compared content before unlinking. That asymmetry is the defect: the
 *    discipline existed in the codebase, it was simply not applied on the
 *    write side. `classifyMarker` is now the shared predicate behind both
 *    `ensureCommonJsMarker` and `removeCommonJsMarker`, so install and
 *    uninstall cannot drift apart again.
 *
 * Ownership is decided by exact content match against the marker GSD itself
 * writes — the same test the uninstall path has always used.

 * Letting it throw made an unwritable marker abort the entire install with a
