# Closed-Phase Gate (#3569)

The init JSON includes `phase_status` — one of `Pending | Planned | In Progress | Executed | Complete | Needs Review`. `Complete` means the phase has all summaries AND a `VERIFICATION.md` with `status: passed`. Replanning a closed phase silently rewrites plan docs that no longer match the shipped code, so the workflow must hard-stop here unless the operator explicitly overrides.

Parse `phase_status` from the init JSON, then:

```bash
FORCE_REPLAN=false
if [[ "{{GSD_ARGS}}" =~ (^|[[:space:]])--force([[:space:]]|$) ]]; then
  FORCE_REPLAN=true
fi

if [ "${phase_status}" = "Complete" ]; then
  if [[ "{{GSD_ARGS}}" =~ (^|[[:space:]])--reviews([[:space:]]|$) ]]; then
    # --reviews on a closed phase is never legitimate — concerns belong in a
    # new phase or issue against the closed phase's commits.
    cat <<EOF >&2
Phase ${phase_number} (${phase_name}) is already CLOSED (VERIFICATION status: passed).
$gsd-plan-phase --reviews cannot replan a closed phase. If the review surfaced
real concerns, open a follow-up phase or file an issue against the closed
phase's commits. There is no --force override for --reviews on a closed phase.
EOF
    exit 1
  fi
  if [ "$FORCE_REPLAN" != "true" ]; then
    cat <<EOF >&2
Phase ${phase_number} (${phase_name}) is already CLOSED (VERIFICATION status: passed).
Replanning a closed phase will overwrite plan docs that no longer match the
shipped code. If you intentionally want to replan over closed work, re-run
with: $gsd-plan-phase ${phase_number} --force

Otherwise, to view what shipped, see: ${verification_path}
EOF
    exit 1
  fi
  # FORCE_REPLAN=true: continue, but emit a banner so the operator sees the
  # decision in the transcript and in any committed plan docs.
  echo "WARNING: Replanning CLOSED phase ${phase_number} under --force. Verify the closeout was wrong before committing new plan docs." >&2
fi
```

The gate fires only on `Complete`. `Executed` and `Needs Review` are not gated — those states mean planning was finished but verification did not pass, and replanning is a legitimate next step.
