## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-map-codebase`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-map-codebase` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, activate TEXT_MODE: append `--text` to `{{GSD_ARGS}}` so the workflow's built-in text-mode branching takes over. Present every `AskUserQuestion` call as a plain-text numbered list, then stop and wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018 / #3808).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

**Schema detection (required first step):** Before spawning, inspect the `spawn_agent`
tool's visible parameter schema (via `tool_search` or the tool list). Use the presence
of `agent_type` only to choose typed dispatch versus the generic-agent workaround.
Detect optional fields independently: `model`, `reasoning_effort`, `task_name`,
`fork_turns`, and `fork_context` may be added or removed without `agent_type` changing.
Never infer one field from a schema/version label or from the presence of another field.

- **agent_type-capable schema:** `spawn_agent` advertises `agent_type` — typed GSD agent dispatch is available.
- **Generic schema:** `spawn_agent` does not advertise `agent_type` — typed GSD agent dispatch is unavailable in this session, even if other optional fields are present.

Typed mapping (agent_type-capable schema only):
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Agent(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="{resolved_model}")` → pass `model="{resolved_model}"` when the
  visible `spawn_agent` schema advertises `model` and the resolved value is explicit.
  This is how `model_profile` tier routing, including `adaptive`, reaches the child agent.
  Omit `model` only when the schema does not advertise `model`, or when the value is
  missing, empty, or `"inherit"`; omission deliberately inherits the session/static agent
  configuration. Explicit `model_overrides` may also be embedded in agent `.toml` files,
  but ordinary profile-resolved models are not, so a TOML file is not a reason to discard
  an available inline value.
- Before each typed spawn, obtain the paired effort for its role with
  `gsd_run query resolve-model <subagent_type> --pick effort` when the workflow has not
  already exposed it. The resolver's unified `effort` field maps to the Codex spawn argument
  `reasoning_effort`; do not look for a resolver field named `reasoning_effort`.
  Pass it when the visible `spawn_agent` schema advertises `reasoning_effort`. Omit the
  field when it is not advertised, or when the value is missing, empty, `"inherit"`, or
  unsupported; do not invent one-off effort literals in workflow prose.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<required_reading>` blocks
- `task_name` — when advertised, provide a descriptive name for each spawned task
- `fork_turns` — when advertised, controls turn-forking depth; coexists with `fork_context` (not a replacement)
- `Task(isolation="worktree")` / `Agent(isolation="worktree")` → no direct `spawn_agent` mapping,
  but Codex declares `dispatch.isolation: orchestrator-worktree` (#2584). Codex
  `spawn_agent` still does not create or bind a git worktree; instead GSD itself
  creates the worktree and process-spawns the executor into it with
  `codex exec --cd <dir>`, performing every git operation on the executor's behalf
  (its `workspace-write` sandbox makes `.git` read-only). Workflows must therefore
  never fabricate a manual worktree protocol — route through the negotiated
  isolation adapter, which still fails closed for hosts declaring `none` (#3360).

Generic-agent workaround (multi_agent_v1 schema — NO agent_type field):
When only the generic `multi_agent_v1` schema is available, typed GSD agent dispatch
(`gsd-planner`, `gsd-executor`, etc.) is NOT possible. This is a known Codex limitation
(openai/codex#15250). **This workaround is NOT equivalent to typed gsd-planner/gsd-executor
execution** — GSD agents carry project-aware prompts, audit logging, and workflow context
that a generic subagent lacks. Use the following fallback:
1. Resolve your active Codex config root — the directory that contains your `config.toml`.
   This directory is determined in priority order: `$CODEX_HOME` (if set), the path given
   by `--config-dir` (if passed on invocation), a local `.codex` directory in the current
   project (if `--local` was used), or the default global config directory. Read
   `agents/<agent-name>.toml` relative to that config root to extract the agent's system
   instructions.
2. Inject those instructions as a role-preamble into a generic `spawn_agent(message=...)` call.
3. Label results and logs clearly as "generic-agent workaround" so the orchestrator and user
   know full typed-agent guarantees are not in effect.
4. Where typed dispatch is mandatory for correctness (e.g. worktree isolation), fail closed
   and report the schema limitation rather than silently degrading.

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.
- In some Codex sessions, multi-agent tooling can be deferred. If `spawn_agent`
  is not currently visible, discover tools first via `tool_search` before
  defaulting to inline execution.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `collaboration.wait_agent(timeout_ms=...)` for each to complete
- Do NOT use `functions.wait(cell_id=...)` — that is an unrelated exec-cell tool, not the collaboration wait

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results — but only if `close_agent` is visible in the current
  tool schema (check via `tool_search` first, same schema-detection gate as `spawn_agent` above)
</codex_skill_adapter>

<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.codex/gsd-core/workflows/map-codebase.md
</execution_context>

<flags>
- **--fast**: Lightweight scan mode — spawns one mapper agent instead of four. Accepts an optional `--focus` value: `tech`, `arch`, `quality`, `concerns`, or `tech+arch` (default). Faster and lower-context than the full map.
- **--query**: Codebase intelligence query mode. Sub-commands: `query <term>`, `status`, `diff`, `refresh`. Requires intel to be enabled in config (`intel.enabled: true`). Runs inline for query/status/diff; spawns an agent for refresh.
- **(no flag)**: Full parallel map — spawns 4 mapper agents to produce all 7 codebase documents.
</flags>

<context>
Arguments: {{GSD_ARGS}}

Parse the first token of {{GSD_ARGS}}:
- If it is `--fast`: strip the flag, then read and execute `/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.codex/gsd-core/workflows/scan.md` (passing remaining args including optional --focus). Load it on demand here — it is deliberately not in `<execution_context>`, so the common full-map path does not pay for it.
- If it is `--query`: strip the flag, run the intel workflow (passing remaining args as the subcommand).
- Otherwise: pass all of {{GSD_ARGS}} as focus area to the map-codebase workflow.

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Via $gsd-onboard for first-time brownfield setup - creates codebase map first
- After $gsd-new-project (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**
- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Refreshing or deepening an onboarded codebase map
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip map-codebase for:**
- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: $gsd-onboard, $gsd-new-project, or $gsd-plan-phase)
