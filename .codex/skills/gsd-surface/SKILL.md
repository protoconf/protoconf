<codex_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-surface`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-surface` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. AskUserQuestion → request_user_input Mapping
GSD workflows use `AskUserQuestion` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex `request_user_input`:

Parameter mapping:
- `header` → `header`
- `question` → `question`
- Options formatted as `"Label" — description` → `{label: "Label", description: "description"}`
- Generate `id` from header: lowercase, replace spaces with underscores

Batched calls:
- `AskUserQuestion([q1, q2])` → single `request_user_input` with multiple entries in `questions[]`

Multi-select workaround:
- Codex has no `multiSelect`. Use sequential single-selects, or present a numbered freeform list asking the user to enter comma-separated numbers.

Execute mode fallback:
- When `request_user_input` is rejected or unavailable, activate TEXT_MODE: append `--text` to `{{GSD_ARGS}}` so the workflow's built-in text-mode branching takes over. Present every `AskUserQuestion` call as a plain-text numbered list, then stop and wait for the user's reply. Do NOT pick a default and continue (#3018 / #3808).
- You may only proceed without a user answer when one of these is true:
  (a) the invocation included an explicit non-interactive flag (`--auto` or `--all`),
  (b) the user has explicitly approved a specific default for this question, or
  (c) the workflow's documented contract says defaults are safe (e.g. autonomous lifecycle paths).
- Do NOT write workflow artifacts (CONTEXT.md, DISCUSSION-LOG.md, PLAN.md, checkpoint files) until the user has answered the plain-text questions or one of (a)-(c) above applies. Surfacing the questions and waiting is the correct response — silently defaulting and writing artifacts is the #3018 failure mode.

## C. Task() → spawn_agent Mapping
GSD workflows use `Task(...)` (Claude Code syntax). Translate to Codex collaboration tools:

**Schema detection (required first step):** Before spawning, inspect the `spawn_agent`
tool's visible parameter schema (via `tool_search` or the tool list). Use the presence
of `agent_type` only to choose typed dispatch versus the generic-agent workaround.
Detect optional fields independently: `model`, `reasoning_effort`, `task_name`,
`fork_turns`, and `fork_context` may be added or removed without `agent_type` changing.
Never infer one field from a schema/version label or from the presence of another field.

- **agent_type-capable schema:** `spawn_agent` advertises `agent_type` — typed GSD agent dispatch is available.
- **Generic schema:** `spawn_agent` does not advertise `agent_type` — typed GSD agent dispatch is unavailable in this session, even if other optional fields are present.

Typed mapping (agent_type-capable schema only):
- `Task(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Agent(subagent_type="X", prompt="Y")` → `spawn_agent(agent_type="X", message="Y")`
- `Task(model="{resolved_model}")` → pass `model="{resolved_model}"` when the
  visible `spawn_agent` schema advertises `model` and the resolved value is explicit.
  This is how `model_profile` tier routing, including `adaptive`, reaches the child agent.
  Omit `model` only when the schema does not advertise `model`, or when the value is
  missing, empty, or `"inherit"`; omission deliberately inherits the session/static agent
  configuration. Explicit `model_overrides` may also be embedded in agent `.toml` files,
  but ordinary profile-resolved models are not, so a TOML file is not a reason to discard
  an available inline value.
- Before each typed spawn, obtain the paired effort for its role with
  `gsd_run query resolve-model <subagent_type> --pick effort` when the workflow has not
  already exposed it. The resolver's unified `effort` field maps to the Codex spawn argument
  `reasoning_effort`; do not look for a resolver field named `reasoning_effort`.
  Pass it when the visible `spawn_agent` schema advertises `reasoning_effort`. Omit the
  field when it is not advertised, or when the value is missing, empty, `"inherit"`, or
  unsupported; do not invent one-off effort literals in workflow prose.
- `fork_context: false` by default — GSD agents load their own context via `<required_reading>` blocks
- `task_name` — when advertised, provide a descriptive name for each spawned task
- `fork_turns` — when advertised, controls turn-forking depth; coexists with `fork_context` (not a replacement)
- `Task(isolation="worktree")` / `Agent(isolation="worktree")` → no direct `spawn_agent` mapping,
  but Codex declares `dispatch.isolation: orchestrator-worktree` (#2584). Codex
  `spawn_agent` still does not create or bind a git worktree; instead GSD itself
  creates the worktree and process-spawns the executor into it with
  `codex exec --cd <dir>`, performing every git operation on the executor's behalf
  (its `workspace-write` sandbox makes `.git` read-only). Workflows must therefore
  never fabricate a manual worktree protocol — route through the negotiated
  isolation adapter, which still fails closed for hosts declaring `none` (#3360).

Generic-agent workaround (multi_agent_v1 schema — NO agent_type field):
When only the generic `multi_agent_v1` schema is available, typed GSD agent dispatch
(`gsd-planner`, `gsd-executor`, etc.) is NOT possible. This is a known Codex limitation
(openai/codex#15250). **This workaround is NOT equivalent to typed gsd-planner/gsd-executor
execution** — GSD agents carry project-aware prompts, audit logging, and workflow context
that a generic subagent lacks. Use the following fallback:
1. Resolve your active Codex config root — the directory that contains your `config.toml`.
   This directory is determined in priority order: `$CODEX_HOME` (if set), the path given
   by `--config-dir` (if passed on invocation), a local `.codex` directory in the current
   project (if `--local` was used), or the default global config directory. Read
   `agents/<agent-name>.toml` relative to that config root to extract the agent's system
   instructions.
2. Inject those instructions as a role-preamble into a generic `spawn_agent(message=...)` call.
3. Label results and logs clearly as "generic-agent workaround" so the orchestrator and user
   know full typed-agent guarantees are not in effect.
4. Where typed dispatch is mandatory for correctness (e.g. worktree isolation), fail closed
   and report the schema limitation rather than silently degrading.

Spawn restriction:
- Codex restricts `spawn_agent` to cases where the user has explicitly
  requested sub-agents. When automatic spawning is not permitted, do the
  work inline in the current agent rather than attempting to force a spawn.
- In some Codex sessions, multi-agent tooling can be deferred. If `spawn_agent`
  is not currently visible, discover tools first via `tool_search` before
  defaulting to inline execution.

Parallel fan-out:
- Spawn multiple agents → collect agent IDs → `collaboration.wait_agent(timeout_ms=...)` for each to complete
- Do NOT use `functions.wait(cell_id=...)` — that is an unrelated exec-cell tool, not the collaboration wait

Result parsing:
- Look for structured markers in agent output: `CHECKPOINT`, `PLAN COMPLETE`, `SUMMARY`, etc.
- `close_agent(id)` after collecting results — but only if `close_agent` is visible in the current
  tool schema (check via `tool_search` first, same schema-detection gate as `spawn_agent` above)

## Sub-command routing

Parse the first token of {{GSD_ARGS}}:

| Token | Action |
|---|---|
| `list` | Show enabled + disabled clusters and skills |
| `status` | Alias for `list` plus token cost summary |
| `profile <name>` | Write `baseProfile` and re-stage |
| `profile <n1>,<n2>` | Composed profiles (comma-separated, no spaces) |
| `disable <cluster>` | Add cluster to `disabledClusters`, re-stage |
| `enable <cluster>` | Remove cluster from `disabledClusters`, re-stage |
| `reset` | Delete `.gsd-surface.json`, return to install-time profile |
| *(none)* | Treat as `list` |

---

## list / status

Load the capability registry and call `listSurface(runtimeConfigDir, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry)` from
the engine module at `${runtimeConfigDir}/gsd-core/bin/lib/surface.cjs`. The registry is loaded via:
```js
const registry = require(runtimeConfigDir + '/gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
```
Display:

```
Enabled (N skills, ~T tokens):
  core_loop:   new-project  discuss-phase  plan-phase  execute-phase  help  update
  audit_review: …
  …

Disabled:
  utility:  health  stats  settings  …

Token cost: ~T (budget cap ~500 tokens for 200k context @ 1%)
```

For `status` also append:

```
Base profile:   standard  (from .gsd-surface.json)
Install profile: standard  (from .gsd-profile)
```

---

## Mutation protocol

Derive the next `surfaceState` in memory and pass it to `applySurface` as
`opts.surfaceState`. Do not call `writeSurface` first: `applySurface` stages all
artifact kinds before mutation and publishes the candidate state only after
materialization succeeds. Pass `null` to reset to the install-time profile.

---

## profile \<name\>

1. Read current surface: `readSurface(runtimeConfigDir)` → if null, seed from `readActiveProfile(runtimeConfigDir)`.
2. Set `surfaceState.baseProfile = name`.
3. Keep the new state in memory; do not write it directly.
4. Resolve and re-apply:
   ```js
   const registry = require(runtimeConfigDir + '/gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
   const layout = resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, runtimeConfigDir, scope);
   applySurface(runtimeConfigDir, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry, { surfaceState });
   ```
5. Confirm: "Surface updated to profile `<name>`. N skills enabled."

---

## disable \<cluster\>

Valid cluster names: `core_loop`, `audit_review`, `milestone`, `research_ideate`,
`workspace_state`, `docs`, `ui`, `ai_eval`, `ns_meta`, `utility`.

1. Validate cluster name against `Object.keys(CLUSTERS)`.
2. Read or initialize surface state.
3. Add cluster to `surfaceState.disabledClusters` (deduplicate).
4. Resolve layout and apply the in-memory candidate:
   ```js
   const registry = require(runtimeConfigDir + '/gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
   const layout = resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, runtimeConfigDir, scope);
   applySurface(runtimeConfigDir, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry, { surfaceState });
   ```
5. Confirm: "Disabled cluster `<cluster>`. N skills removed from surface."

---

## enable \<cluster\>

1. Read surface state; if null, nothing to enable — print "No surface delta active."
2. Remove cluster from `surfaceState.disabledClusters`.
3. Resolve layout and apply the in-memory candidate:
   ```js
   const registry = require(runtimeConfigDir + '/gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
   const layout = resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, runtimeConfigDir, scope);
   applySurface(runtimeConfigDir, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry, { surfaceState });
   ```
4. Confirm: "Enabled cluster `<cluster>`. N skills added back to surface."

---

## reset

1. Check if `.gsd-surface.json` exists.
2. Do not delete it directly.
3. Re-apply with `{ surfaceState: null }`; the state file is removed only after
   the install-time profile materializes successfully.
4. Confirm: "Surface reset to install-time profile `<name>`."

---

## runtimeConfigDir resolution

The `runtimeConfigDir` for `applySurface` is the **base the agent config directory**
(`~/.codex`), NOT the skills sub-directory (`/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.codex/skills`).

This matches `installRuntimeArtifacts` and `uninstallRuntimeArtifacts`, which also
receive `~/.codex` as `configDir`. The skill dirs themselves live at
`/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.codex/skills/gsd-*/` because the `claude global` layout has `destSubpath =
'skills'` — they are derived from `configDir`, not the root for it.

```bash
# Claude Code — global install
RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR="${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codex}"
SCOPE="global"

# Artifact destinations are derived from runtime layout
# via resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR, SCOPE)
# then applySurface(RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS)
```

Surface state is stored at `${RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR}/.gsd-surface.json`
(i.e. `/Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.codex/.gsd-surface.json`).

All paths can be overridden by reading the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var if set.

## Error handling

- Unknown cluster name → list valid cluster names, exit without writing.
- Unknown profile name → list known profiles (`core`, `standard`, `full`), exit.
- Missing `surface.cjs` → prompt: "Run `npm i -g @opengsd/gsd-core` to reinstall GSD."
