description: "Analyze codebase with parallel mapper agents to produce .planning/codebase/ documents"
---


<objective>
Analyze existing codebase using parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents to produce structured codebase documents.

Each mapper agent explores a focus area and **writes documents directly** to `.planning/codebase/`. The orchestrator only receives confirmations, keeping context usage minimal.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.agents/gsd-core/workflows/map-codebase.md
</execution_context>

<flags>
- **--fast**: Lightweight scan mode — spawns one mapper agent instead of four. Accepts an optional `--focus` value: `tech`, `arch`, `quality`, `concerns`, or `tech+arch` (default). Faster and lower-context than the full map.
- **--query**: Codebase intelligence query mode. Sub-commands: `query <term>`, `status`, `diff`, `refresh`. Requires intel to be enabled in config (`intel.enabled: true`). Runs inline for query/status/diff; spawns an agent for refresh.
- **(no flag)**: Full parallel map — spawns 4 mapper agents to produce all 7 codebase documents.
</flags>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--fast`: strip the flag, then read and execute `.agents/gsd-core/workflows/scan.md` (passing remaining args including optional --focus). Load it on demand here — it is deliberately not in `<execution_context>`, so the common full-map path does not pay for it.
- If it is `--query`: strip the flag, run the intel workflow (passing remaining args as the subcommand).
- Otherwise: pass all of $ARGUMENTS as focus area to the map-codebase workflow.

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for .planning/STATE.md - loads context if project already initialized

**This command can run:**
- Via /gsd-onboard for first-time brownfield setup - creates codebase map first
- After /gsd-new-project (greenfield codebases) - updates codebase map as code evolves
- Anytime to refresh codebase understanding
</context>

<when_to_use>
**Use map-codebase for:**
- Brownfield projects before initialization (understand existing code first)
- Refreshing codebase map after significant changes
- Refreshing or deepening an onboarded codebase map
- Before major refactoring (understand current state)
- When STATE.md references outdated codebase info

**Skip map-codebase for:**
- Greenfield projects with no code yet (nothing to map)
- Trivial codebases (<5 files)
</when_to_use>

<process>
1. Check if .planning/codebase/ already exists (offer to refresh or skip)
2. Create .planning/codebase/ directory structure
3. Spawn 4 parallel gsd-codebase-mapper agents:
   - Agent 1: tech focus → writes STACK.md, INTEGRATIONS.md
   - Agent 2: arch focus → writes ARCHITECTURE.md, STRUCTURE.md
   - Agent 3: quality focus → writes CONVENTIONS.md, TESTING.md
   - Agent 4: concerns focus → writes CONCERNS.md
4. Wait for agents to complete, collect confirmations (NOT document contents)
5. Verify all 7 documents exist with line counts
6. Commit codebase map
7. Offer next steps (typically: /gsd-onboard, /gsd-new-project, or /gsd-plan-phase)
</process>
