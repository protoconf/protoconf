description: "Spike an idea through experiential exploration, or propose what to spike next (frontier mode)"

<objective>
Spike an idea through experiential exploration — build focused experiments to feel the pieces
of a future app, validate feasibility, and produce verified knowledge for the real build.
Spikes live in `.planning/spikes/` and integrate with GSD commit patterns, state tracking,
and handoff workflows.

Two modes:
- **Idea mode** (default) — describe an idea to spike
- **Frontier mode** (no argument or "frontier") — analyzes existing spike landscape and proposes integration and frontier spikes

Does not require prior new-project setup — auto-creates `.planning/spikes/` if needed.
</objective>

**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`.

<context>
Idea: $ARGUMENTS

**Available flags:**
- `--quick` — Skip decomposition/alignment, jump straight to building. Use when you already know what to spike.
- `--text` — Use plain-text numbered lists instead of AskUserQuestion (for non-the agent runtimes).
- `--wrap-up` — Package spike findings into a persistent project skill for future build conversations. Runs the spike-wrap-up workflow.
</context>

<process>
Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--wrap-up`: strip the flag, execute the spike-wrap-up workflow
- Otherwise: pass all of $ARGUMENTS as the idea to the spike workflow end-to-end.

Preserve all workflow gates (prior spike check, decomposition, research, risk ordering, observability assessment, verification, MANIFEST updates, commit patterns).
