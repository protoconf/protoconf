description: "Sketch UI/design ideas with throwaway HTML mockups, or propose what to sketch next (frontier mode)"
---

<objective>
Explore design directions through throwaway HTML mockups before committing to implementation.
Each sketch produces 2-3 variants for comparison. Sketches live in `.planning/sketches/` and
integrate with GSD commit patterns, state tracking, and handoff workflows. Loads spike
findings to ground mockups in real data shapes and validated interaction patterns.

Two modes:
- **Idea mode** (default) — describe a design idea to sketch
- **Frontier mode** (no argument or "frontier") — analyzes existing sketch landscape and proposes consistency and frontier sketches

Does not require prior new-project setup — auto-creates `.planning/sketches/` if needed.

Design idea: $ARGUMENTS

**Available flags:**
- `--quick` — Skip mood/direction intake, jump straight to decomposition and building. Use when the design direction is already clear.
- `--wrap-up` — Package sketch design findings into a persistent project skill for future build conversations. Runs the sketch-wrap-up workflow.
</context>

<process>
Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--wrap-up`: strip the flag, execute the sketch-wrap-up workflow end-to-end.
- Otherwise: execute the sketch workflow end-to-end.

Preserve all workflow gates (intake, decomposition, target stack research, variant evaluation, MANIFEST updates, commit patterns).
