description: "Validate built features through conversational UAT"

<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what the agent built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.

Output: {phase_num}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /gsd-execute-phase
</objective>
