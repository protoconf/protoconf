// Context Monitor - PostToolUse/AfterTool hook (Gemini uses AfterTool)
// Reads context metrics from the statusline bridge file and injects
// warnings when context usage is high. This makes the AGENT aware of
// context limits (the statusline only shows the user).
//
// How it works:
// 1. The statusline hook writes metrics to /tmp/claude-ctx-{session_id}.json
// 2. This hook reads those metrics after each tool use
// 3. When remaining context drops below thresholds, it injects a warning
//    as additionalContext, which the agent sees in its conversation
//
// Thresholds:
//   WARNING  (remaining <= 35%): Agent should wrap up current task
//   CRITICAL (remaining <= 25%): Agent should stop immediately and save state
//
// Debounce: 5 tool uses between warnings to avoid spam
// Severity escalation bypasses debounce (WARNING -> CRITICAL fires immediately)

// sitting there may be a planted symlink. The three routine debounce-accounting writes were bare
// writeFileSync, which follows one and writes through to its target, while the
// PreCompact clear and the compaction watermark in this same file already
// refuse to. Unlink-then-O_EXCL is the watermark's own shape (the watermark
// write itself now calls this helper — review round 10): the unlink
// removes any existing object (regular file or link) and O_EXCL then refuses
// to create through one, so the write can only ever land on a fresh regular
// file this process made. Best effort by design — a lost sentinel write costs
// only debounce accounting, which is never worth breaking the hook over, so
// every failure is swallowed exactly as the watermark write's is.
// NOT an atomic read-modify-write, and not claimed to be (Codex review of
// #3808, round 7): two concurrent invocations can read the same state and race
// through unlink/create, so one invocation's accounting can be lost — the same
// lost-update race the bare writeFileSync already had, not a class this change
// introduces. What a lost write leaves behind is whatever the competing writer
// wrote, which may be a perfectly valid sentinel; it does not reliably mean
// "defaults on the next call". Advisory debounce bookkeeping is the right place
// to accept that.
// The read-side twin of writeSentinel (review of #3808, round 9). Both
// sentinel files this hook reads — the compaction watermark and the warn
// state — must be read the same way: lstat first so a planted link, FIFO or
// directory is refused before any open; O_NOFOLLOW so a link raced in between
// is refused by the kernel too (0 on Windows, where lstat already carries the
// check); a 4096-byte bound so a planted large file cannot stall a
// synchronous read. Rounds 4 and 7 each wrote that sequence inline at their
// own call site, which left two copies to keep in step by hand. One place
// now. Refusal THROWS; every caller already wraps the read in a try/catch and
// degrades to "no file", which is the same behaviour the inline copies had.
