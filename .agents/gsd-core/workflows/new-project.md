<purpose>
Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning, research (optional), requirements, roadmap. This is the most leveraged moment in any project — deep questioning here means better plans, better execution, better outcomes. One workflow takes you from idea to ready-for-planning.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<available_agent_types>
Valid GSD subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- gsd-project-researcher — Researches project-level technical decisions
- gsd-research-synthesizer — Synthesizes findings from parallel research agents
- gsd-roadmapper — Creates phased execution roadmaps
</available_agent_types>

<auto_mode>

If `section_manifest` is `null` or `"auto-mode-detection"` is in its `included` list: read and execute `gsd-core/workflows/new-project/steps/auto-mode-detection.md`. Otherwise skip — do not read the file.

## 1. Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

```bash
_GSD_SHIM_NAME="gsd-tools.cjs"; _GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT="${RUNTIME_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"; GSD_TOOLS="${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; _gsd_at() { for _p; do if [ -f "$_p" ]; then GSD_TOOLS="$_p"; return 0; fi; done; return 1; }; if _gsd_at "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.agents/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.codex/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif unset -f gsd_run; _G="$(command -v gsd_run)"; then GSD_TOOLS="$_G"; gsd_run() { "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif _gsd_at "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cursor}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.copilot}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codeium/windsurf}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.augment}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${TRAE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.trae}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${QWEN_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.qwen}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codebuddy}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CLINE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cline}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GROK_AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini/antigravity}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/opencode}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${KILO_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/kilo}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; else echo "ERROR: gsd-tools.cjs not found at $GSD_TOOLS and gsd_run is not on PATH. Run: npx -y @opengsd/gsd-core@latest --claude --local" >&2; exit 1; fi; GSD_IDENTITY_STATUS=unverified; case "$(gsd_run runtime-identity --raw 2>/dev/null || true)" in '{"packageName":"@opengsd/gsd-core"'*'}') GSD_IDENTITY_STATUS=ok;; esac; export GSD_IDENTITY_STATUS; [ "$GSD_IDENTITY_STATUS" = ok ] || echo "WARNING: \"$GSD_TOOLS\" did not prove it is @opengsd/gsd-core - it is either a different package or an @opengsd/gsd-core older than the runtime-identity verb.

AUTO_PARAM=""; if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ (^|[[:space:]])--auto([[:space:]]|$) ]]; then AUTO_PARAM="--auto"; fi
INIT=$(gsd_run query init.new-project $AUTO_PARAM)
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
AGENT_SKILLS_RESEARCHER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-project-researcher)
AGENT_SKILLS_SYNTHESIZER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-research-synthesizer)
AGENT_SKILLS_ROADMAPPER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-roadmapper)
```

Parse JSON for: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `project_exists`, `has_codebase_map`, `planning_exists`, `has_existing_code`, `has_package_file`, `is_brownfield`, `needs_codebase_map`, `has_git`, `git_worktree_root`, `in_nested_subdir`, `project_path`, `agents_installed`, `missing_agents`, `agent_runtime`, `agents_dir`, `required_agents`, `required_agents_installed`, `missing_required_agents`, `agent_skill_payloads_available`, `agent_skill_payload_agents`, `requirements_exists`, `init_incomplete`, `requirements_path`, `roadmap_path`, `config_path`, `research_dir`, `response_language`.

**If `response_language` is set:** All user-facing output of this workflow — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, findings, questions, prompts, and explanations — MUST be presented in `{response_language}`. Technical terms, code, file paths, and subagent prompts stay in English — only user-facing output is translated.

**If `agents_installed` is false:** Display a warning before proceeding:
```text
⚠ GSD agents not installed. The following agents are missing from your agents directory:
  {missing_agents joined with newline}

Runtime checked: {agent_runtime}
Agents directory checked: {agents_dir}
Required new-project agents missing:
  {missing_required_agents joined with newline, or "none"}

Agent skill payloads available: {agent_skill_payloads_available}
Agent skill payload agents:
  {agent_skill_payload_agents joined with newline, or "none"}

Skill payloads only provide prompt context. Named subagent spawns still require agent
definitions to be installed for this runtime.

Subagent spawns (gsd-project-researcher, gsd-research-synthesizer, gsd-roadmapper) will fail
with "agent type not found" if `required_agents_installed` is false. Run the installer with --global to make agents available:

  npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest --global

Proceeding without research subagents — roadmap will be generated inline.
```
Skip Steps 6–7 (parallel research and synthesis) and proceed directly to roadmap creation in Step 8.

**Detect runtime and set instruction file name:**

Derive `RUNTIME` from the invoking prompt's `execution_context` path:
- Path contains `/.codex/` → `RUNTIME=codex`
- Path contains `/.gemini/` → `RUNTIME=gemini`
- Path contains `/.config/opencode/` or `/.opencode/` → `RUNTIME=opencode`
- Path contains `/.trae/` → `RUNTIME=trae`
- Otherwise → `RUNTIME=claude`

If `execution_context` path is not available, fall back to env vars:
```bash
if [ -n "$CODEX_HOME" ]; then RUNTIME="codex"
elif [ -n "$GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR" ]; then RUNTIME="gemini"
elif [ -n "$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR" ] || [ -n "$OPENCODE_CONFIG" ]; then RUNTIME="opencode"
elif [ -n "$TRAE_CONFIG_DIR" ]; then RUNTIME="trae"
else RUNTIME="claude"; fi
```

Set the instruction file variable via the shared runtime-name policy adapter (`gsd_run query project-instruction-file`, backed by `getProjectInstructionFile` in `runtime-name-policy.cjs` — the single source of truth shared with `profile-output.cjs`):
```bash
INSTRUCTION_FILE=$(gsd_run query project-instruction-file --runtime "$RUNTIME")
```

All subsequent references to the project instruction file use `$INSTRUCTION_FILE`.

**If `project_exists` is true and `init_incomplete` is true (#4040 — interrupted bootstrap):** Resume initialization instead of erroring. `.planning/` exists but initialization stopped before all core artifacts landed. Keep the existing `PROJECT.md` and any already-created artifacts (`REQUIREMENTS.md` if present, `config.json`); skip the steps that would recreate them and continue the flow from the first missing artifact in init order — `REQUIREMENTS.md` → `ROADMAP.md` + `STATE.md` — until all exist. Do not error and do not bounce the user back to `/gsd-progress` (that routing loop is the #4040 bug).

**If `project_exists` is true and `init_incomplete` is false:** Error — project already initialized. Use `/gsd-progress`.

**Git init (#3491 — never nest `.git` inside an existing worktree):**

- If `has_git` true and `in_nested_subdir` true: skip `git init`; warn `⚠ Initializing inside existing worktree (${git_worktree_root}); planning files will track to outer repo.`
- If `has_git` true and `in_nested_subdir` false: skip `git init` (already at worktree root).
- If `has_git` false: `git init`.

## 2. Brownfield Offer

**If auto mode:** Skip to Step 4 (assume greenfield, synthesize PROJECT.md from provided document).

If `section_manifest` is `null` or `"codebase-map-offer"` is in its `included` list: read and execute `gsd-core/workflows/new-project/steps/codebase-map-offer.md`. Otherwise skip — do not read the file.

**If "Skip mapping" OR `needs_codebase_map` is false:** Continue to Step 3.

If `section_manifest` is `null` or `"auto-mode-config"` is in its `included` list: read and execute `gsd-core/workflows/new-project/steps/auto-mode-config.md`. Otherwise skip — do not read the file.

## 2b. Prior Spike/Sketch Detection

Check for existing spike and sketch work that should inform project setup:

```bash
# Check for spike findings skill (project-local)
SPIKE_SKILL=$(ls ./.agents/skills/spike-findings-*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)

# Check for sketch findings skill (project-local)
SKETCH_SKILL=$(ls ./.agents/skills/sketch-findings-*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 || true)

# Check for raw spikes/sketches in .planning/
HAS_SPIKES=$(ls .planning/spikes/MANIFEST.md 2>/dev/null)
HAS_SKETCHES=$(ls .planning/sketches/MANIFEST.md 2>/dev/null)
```

If any of these exist, surface them before questioning:

```
⚡ Prior exploration detected:
{if SPIKE_SKILL}  ✓ Spike findings skill: {path} — validated patterns from experiments
{if SKETCH_SKILL}  ✓ Sketch findings skill: {path} — validated design decisions
{if HAS_SPIKES && !SPIKE_SKILL}  ◆ Raw spikes in .planning/spikes/ — consider `/gsd-spike --wrap-up` to package findings
{if HAS_SKETCHES && !SKETCH_SKILL}  ◆ Raw sketches in .planning/sketches/ — consider `/gsd-sketch --wrap-up` to package findings

These findings will be incorporated into project context and available to planning agents.
```

If spike/sketch findings skills exist, read their SKILL.md files to inform the questioning phase — they contain validated patterns, constraints, and design decisions that should shape the project definition.

## 3. Deep Questioning

**If auto mode:** Skip (already handled in Step 2a). Extract project context from provided document instead and proceed to Step 4.

**Display stage banner:**

```
### GSD ► QUESTIONING
```

**Open the conversation:**

Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion):

"What do you want to build?"

Wait for their response. This gives you the context needed to ask intelligent follow-up questions.

**Research-before-questions mode:** Check if `workflow.research_before_questions` is enabled in `.planning/config.json` (or the config from init context). When enabled, before asking follow-up questions about a topic area:

1. Do a brief web search for best practices related to what the user described
2. Mention key findings naturally as you ask questions (e.g., "Most projects like this use X — is that what you're thinking, or something different?")
3. This makes questions more informed without changing the conversational flow

When disabled (default), ask questions directly as before.

**Follow the thread:**

Based on what they said, ask follow-up questions that dig into their response. Use AskUserQuestion with options that probe what they mentioned — interpretations, clarifications, concrete examples.

Keep following threads. Each answer opens new threads to explore. Ask about:

- What excited them
- What problem sparked this
- What they mean by vague terms
- What it would actually look like
- What's already decided

Consult `questioning.md` for techniques:

- Challenge vagueness
- Make abstract concrete
- Surface assumptions
- Find edges
- Reveal motivation

**Check context (background, not out loud):**

As you go, mentally check the context checklist from `questioning.md`. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally. Don't suddenly switch to checklist mode.

**Decision gate:**

When you could write a clear PROJECT.md, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand what you're after. Ready to create PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Create PROJECT.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add, or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Loop until "Create PROJECT.md" selected.

## 4. Write PROJECT.md

**If auto mode:** Synthesize from provided document. No "Ready?" gate was shown — proceed directly to commit.

Synthesize all context into `.planning/PROJECT.md` using the template from `templates/project.md`.

**For greenfield projects:**

Initialize requirements as hypotheses:

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] [Requirement 1]
- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
- [Exclusion 2] — [why]
```

All Active requirements are hypotheses until shipped and validated.

**For brownfield projects (codebase map exists):**

Infer Validated requirements from existing code:

1. Read `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STACK.md`
2. Identify what the codebase already does
3. These become the initial Validated set

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ [Existing capability 1] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 2] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 3] — existing

### Active

- [ ] [New requirement 1]
- [ ] [New requirement 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
```

**Key Decisions:**

Initialize with any decisions made during questioning:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Choice from questioning] | [Why] | — Pending |
```

**Last updated footer:**

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after initialization*
```

**Evolution section** (include at the end of PROJECT.md, before the footer):

```markdown
## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
```

Do not compress. Capture everything gathered.

**Commit PROJECT.md:**

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
gsd_run query commit "docs: initialize project" --files .planning/PROJECT.md
```

## 5. Workflow Preferences

**If auto mode:** Skip — config was collected in Step 2a. Proceed to Step 5.5.

**Check for global defaults** at `~/.gsd/defaults.json`. If the file exists, read and display its contents before asking:

```bash
DEFAULTS_RAW=$(cat ~/.gsd/defaults.json 2>/dev/null)
```

Format the JSON into human-readable bullets using these label mappings:
- `mode` → "Mode"
- `granularity` → "Granularity"
- `parallelization` → "Execution" (`true` → "Parallel", `false` → "Sequential")
- `commit_docs` → "Git Tracking" (`true` → "Yes", `false` → "No")
- `model_profile` → "AI Models"
- `workflow.research` → "Research" (`true` → "Yes", `false` → "No")
- `workflow.plan_check` → "Plan Check" (`true` → "Yes", `false` → "No")
- `workflow.verifier` → "Verifier" (`true` → "Yes", `false` → "No")
- `plan_review.source_grounding` → "Drift Guard" (`true` → "Yes", `false` → "No")

Display above the prompt:

```text
Your saved defaults (~/.gsd/defaults.json):
  • Mode: [value]
  • Granularity: [value]
  • Execution: [Parallel|Sequential]
  • Git Tracking: [Yes|No]
  • AI Models: [value]
  • Research: [Yes|No]
  • Plan Check: [Yes|No]
  • Verifier: [Yes|No]
  • Drift Guard: [Yes|No]
```

Then ask:

```text
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Use these saved defaults?",
    header: "Defaults",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Use as-is (Recommended)", description: "Proceed with the defaults shown above" },
      { label: "Modify some settings", description: "Keep defaults, change a few" },
      { label: "Configure fresh", description: "Walk through all questions from scratch" }
    ]
  }
])
```

**If "Use as-is":** use the defaults values for config.json and skip directly to **Commit config.json** below.

**If "Modify some settings":** present a selection of every setting with its current saved value.

**If TEXT_MODE is active** (non-the agent runtimes): display a numbered list and ask the user to type the numbers of settings they want to change (comma-separated). Parse the response and proceed.

```text
Which settings do you want to change? (enter numbers, comma-separated)

  1. Mode — Currently: [value]
  2. Granularity — Currently: [value]
  3. Execution — Currently: [Parallel|Sequential]
  4. Git Tracking — Currently: [Yes|No]
  5. AI Models — Currently: [value]
  6. Research — Currently: [Yes|No]
  7. Plan Check — Currently: [Yes|No]
  8. Verifier — Currently: [Yes|No]
  9. Drift Guard — Currently: [Yes|No]
```

**Otherwise** (the agent runtime with AskUserQuestion): use a two-block split
to stay within the 4-option runtime cap.

```text
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Do you want to change any core workflow settings (Mode, Granularity, Execution, Git Tracking)?",
    header: "Core Settings",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes", description: "Choose from core workflow settings" },
      { label: "No", description: "Skip core workflow settings" }
    ]
  }
])
```

If "Yes", ask:

```text
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Which core workflow settings do you want to change?",
    header: "Core Select",
    multiSelect: true,
    options: [
      { label: "Mode", description: "Currently: [value]" },
      { label: "Granularity", description: "Currently: [value]" },
      { label: "Execution", description: "Currently: [Parallel|Sequential]" },
      { label: "Git Tracking", description: "Currently: [Yes|No]" }
    ]
  }
])
```

Then ask:

```text
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Do you want to change any model/agent settings (AI Models, Research, Plan Check, Verifier)?",
    header: "Agent Settings",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes", description: "Choose from model/agent settings" },
      { label: "No", description: "Skip model/agent settings" }
    ]
  }
])
```

If "Yes", ask:

```text
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Which model/agent settings do you want to change?",
    header: "Agent Select",
    multiSelect: true,
    options: [
      { label: "AI Models", description: "Currently: [value]" },
      { label: "Research", description: "Currently: [Yes|No]" },
      { label: "Plan Check", description: "Currently: [Yes|No]" },
      { label: "Verifier", description: "Currently: [Yes|No]" }
    ]
  }
])
```

Then ask:

```text
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Do you want to change the Drift Guard setting (plan-review source-grounding)?",
    header: "Drift Guard",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes", description: "Toggle Drift Guard (currently: [Yes|No])" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep current Drift Guard setting" }
    ]
  }
])
```

For each selected setting across both blocks, ask only that question using the
option set from Round 1 / Round 2 below. Merge user answers over the saved
defaults — unchanged settings retain their saved values. Then skip to
**Commit config.json**.

**If "Configure fresh" or `~/.gsd/defaults.json` doesn't exist:** proceed with the questions below.

**Round 1 — Core workflow settings (4 questions):**

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Mode",
    question: "How do you want to work?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "YOLO (Recommended)", description: "Auto-approve, just execute" },
      { label: "Interactive", description: "Confirm at each step" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Granularity",
    question: "How finely should scope be sliced into phases?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Coarse", description: "Fewer, broader phases (3-5 phases, 1-3 plans each)" },
      { label: "Standard", description: "Balanced phase size (5-8 phases, 3-5 plans each)" },
      { label: "Fine", description: "Many focused phases (8-12 phases, 5-10 plans each)" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Execution",
    question: "Run plans in parallel?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent plans run simultaneously" },
      { label: "Sequential", description: "One plan at a time" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Git Tracking",
    question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
      { label: "No", description: "Keep .planning/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents:**

These spawn additional agents during planning/execution. They add tokens and time but improve quality.

| Agent | When it runs | What it does |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Researcher** | Before planning each phase | Investigates domain, finds patterns, surfaces gotchas |
| **Plan Checker** | After plan is created | Verifies plan actually achieves the phase goal |
| **Verifier** | After phase execution | Confirms must-haves were delivered |

All recommended for important projects. Skip for quick experiments.

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Research",

      { label: "No", description: "Execute plans without verification" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Verifier",
    question: "Verify work satisfies requirements after each phase? (adds tokens/time)",

      { label: "No", description: "Trust execution, skip verification" }
    ]
  }
]

**Conditional visibility — model_profile (Q2):**
  Only ask this question when Q1's answer is "Standard tier…".
  If Q1 = "Adaptive (Recommended)" → write model_profile=adaptive and SKIP Q2.
  If Q1 = "Inherit"                → write model_profile=inherit and SKIP Q2.
  If user cancels Q2 after picking "Standard tier…" → leave existing model_profile value unchanged.

```

**PR body onboarding:** Ask which optional PRD-style sections `/gsd-ship` should append to generated PR bodies. Use the same `ship.pr_body_sections` mapping as Step 2a: selected sections get `enabled: true`, seeded-but-unselected sections get `enabled: false`, and selecting none writes an empty list. Prefer lean/agile PRD sections that make user value, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done, and stakeholder traceability explicit.

Recommended options:

- `User Stories & Acceptance Criteria`
- `Risks & Dependencies`
- `Success Metrics & Release Criteria`
- `Stakeholder Review & Approval`

Create `.planning/config.json` with all settings (CLI fills in remaining defaults automatically):

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
gsd_run query config-new-project '{"mode":"[yolo|interactive]","granularity":"[selected]","parallelization":true|false,"commit_docs":true|false,"model_profile":"quality|balanced|budget|adaptive|inherit","workflow":{"research":true|false,"plan_check":true|false,"verifier":true|false,"nyquist_validation":[false if granularity=coarse, true otherwise]},"plan_review":{"source_grounding":true|false},"ship":{"pr_body_sections":[{"heading":"User Stories & Acceptance Criteria","enabled":true|false,"source":"REQUIREMENTS.md ## User Stories || REQUIREMENTS.md ## Acceptance Criteria","fallback":"- Acceptance criteria are covered by the linked requirements and verification evidence."},{"heading":"Risks & Dependencies","enabled":true|false,"source":"PLAN.md ## Risks || PLAN.md ## Dependencies","fallback":"- No known high-risk rollout dependencies."},{"heading":"Success Metrics & Release Criteria","enabled":true|false,"source":"REQUIREMENTS.md ## Definition of Done || VERIFICATION.md ## Release Criteria","fallback":"- Release when automated verification and required manual checks pass."},{"heading":"Stakeholder Review & Approval","enabled":true|false,"template":"- Product owner approval pending for {phase_name}."}]}}'
```

**Note:** Run `/gsd-settings` anytime to update model profile, workflow agents, branching strategy, and other preferences.

**If commit_docs = No:**

- Set `commit_docs: false` in config.json
- Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore` (create if needed)

**If commit_docs = Yes:**

- No additional gitignore entries needed

**Commit config.json:**

```bash
gsd_run query commit "chore: add project config" --files .planning/config.json
```

## 5.1. Sub-Repo Detection

**Detect multi-repo workspace:**

Check for directories with their own `.git` folders (separate repos within the workspace):

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -name ".*" -not -name "node_modules" -exec test -d "{}/.git" \; -print
```

**If sub-repos found:**

Strip the `./` prefix to get directory names (e.g., `./backend` → `backend`).

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Multi-Repo Workspace"
- question: "I detected separate git repos in this workspace. Which directories contain code that GSD should commit to?"
- multiSelect: true
- options: one option per detected directory
  - "[directory name]" — Separate git repo

**If user selects one or more directories:**

- Set `planning.sub_repos` in config.json to the selected directory names array (e.g., `["backend", "frontend"]`)
- Auto-set `planning.commit_docs` to `false` (planning docs stay local in multi-repo workspaces)
- Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore` if not already present

Config changes are saved locally — no commit needed since `commit_docs` is `false` in multi-repo mode.

**If no sub-repos found or user selects none:** Continue with no changes to config.

## 5.5. Resolve Model Profile

Use models from init: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`.

## 6. Research Decision

**If auto mode:** Default to "Research first" without asking.

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover standard stacks, expected features, architecture patterns
  - "Skip research" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**If "Research first":**

Display stage banner:

```
### GSD ► RESEARCHING

Researching [domain] ecosystem...
```

Create research directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/research
```

**Determine milestone context:**

Check if this is greenfield or subsequent milestone:

- If no "Validated" requirements in PROJECT.md → Greenfield (building from scratch)
- If "Validated" requirements exist → Subsequent milestone (adding to existing app)

Display spawning indicator:

```
◆ Spawning 4 researchers in parallel... (each runs in a subagent — no output until they return, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze)

```

Spawn 4 parallel gsd-project-researcher agents with path references:

<!-- #2517 model-omit-on-inherit -->

> **Model omission (#2517).** Omit the `model` parameter entirely when the value it would carry (`researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`) is `"inherit"` or empty. An empty value 404s on runtimes without native tier aliases — the default on non-the agent runtimes. Omitting it inherits the orchestrator's model. See @gsd-core/references/model-profile-resolution.md.

This prevents duplicate work, conflicting edits, and wasted context. Only resume when the subagent result is available.

**Synthesizer output self-heal (#222) — verify SUMMARY.md materialized:** The synthesizer's canonical output is `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` on disk; its brief structured return (`## SYNTHESIS COMPLETE` plus a few `###` confirmation lines) is NOT the file content. A known LLM false-refusal (issue #222) sometimes makes the agent return the full SUMMARY.md document inline — fabricating a write restriction (e.g. "the runtime is blocking file writes") — instead of writing the file. Prompt hardening alone does not fully eliminate it, so the orchestrator MUST absorb the failure deterministically before spawning `gsd-roadmapper`:

1. Verify `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` exists AND is substantive — non-empty, and free of any leftover `<!-- gsd-write-continue -->` continuation sentinel (which marks a truncated/incomplete write). You may validate with `gsd_run verify-summary .planning/research/SUMMARY.md` — it exits 0 regardless, so check its JSON `passed` field (`"passed": false` means missing or invalid), not the process exit code. If it passes, continue normally.
2. If it is MISSING or invalid AND the synthesizer's return message contains the FULL SUMMARY.md document — recognizable by the template's top-level markers `# Project Research Summary`, `## Key Findings`, `## Implications for Roadmap`, and `## Sources`, not merely the brief `## SYNTHESIS COMPLETE` confirmation — the false-refusal fired: write that returned document to `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` with the Write tool, then commit ALL research artifacts the synthesizer owns (it commits on behalf of the four researchers) with `gsd_run query commit "docs: complete project research" --files .planning/research/` unless they are already committed. Log `⚠ #222 self-heal: synthesizer returned SUMMARY.md inline without writing it; orchestrator persisted the file.`
3. If it is MISSING or invalid AND the return is only a brief confirmation (no full SUMMARY document to recover), the synthesizer genuinely failed — surface the error and stop; do NOT spawn `gsd-roadmapper` against a missing or incomplete SUMMARY.md.

This guarantees `gsd-roadmapper` (which lists SUMMARY.md as required reading) never runs against a missing or truncated SUMMARY.md.

```

**If "Skip research":** Continue to Step 7.

## 7. Define Requirements

Display stage banner:

```
### GSD ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
```

**Load context:**

Read PROJECT.md and extract:

- Core value (the ONE thing that must work)
- Stated constraints (budget, timeline, tech limitations)
- Any explicit scope boundaries

**If research exists:** Read research/FEATURES.md and extract feature categories.

**If auto mode:**

- Auto-include all table stakes features (users expect these)
- Include features explicitly mentioned in provided document
- Auto-defer differentiators not mentioned in document
- Skip per-category AskUserQuestion loops
- Skip "Any additions?" question
- Skip requirements approval gate
- Generate REQUIREMENTS.md and commit directly

**Present features by category (interactive mode only):**

```
Here are the features for [domain]:

## Authentication
**Table stakes:**
- Sign up with email/password
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Session management

**Differentiators:**
- Magic link login
- OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- 2FA

**Research notes:** [any relevant notes]

---

## [Next Category]
...
```

**If no research:** Gather requirements through conversation instead.

Ask: "What are the main things users need to be able to do?"

For each capability mentioned:

- Ask clarifying questions to make it specific
- Probe for related capabilities
- Group into categories

**Scope each category:**

For each category, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "[Category]" (max 12 chars)
- question: "Which [category] features are in v1?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "[Feature 1]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 2]" — [brief description]
  - "[Feature 3]" — [brief description]
  - "None for v1" — Defer entire category

Track responses:

- Selected features → v1 requirements
- Unselected table stakes → v2 (users expect these)
- Unselected differentiators → out of scope

**Identify gaps:**

Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Additions"
- question: "Any requirements research missed? (Features specific to your vision)"
- options:
  - "No, research covered it" — Proceed
  - "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Validate core value:**

Cross-check requirements against Core Value from PROJECT.md. If gaps detected, surface them.

**Generate REQUIREMENTS.md:**

Create `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` with:

- v1 Requirements grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs)
- v2 Requirements (deferred)
- Out of Scope (explicit exclusions with reasoning)
- Traceability section (empty, filled by roadmap)

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, CONTENT-02)

**Requirement quality criteria:**

Good requirements are:

- **Specific and testable:** "User can reset password via email link" (not "Handle password reset")
- **User-centric:** "User can X" (not "System does Y")
- **Atomic:** One capability per requirement (not "User can login and manage profile")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

Reject vague requirements. Push for specificity:

- "Handle authentication" → "User can log in with email/password and stay logged in across sessions"
- "Support sharing" → "User can share post via link that opens in recipient's browser"

**Present full requirements list (interactive mode only):**

Show every requirement (not counts) for user confirmation:

```
## v1 Requirements

### Authentication
- [ ] **AUTH-01**: User can create account with email/password
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: User can log in and stay logged in across sessions
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: User can log out from any page

### Content
- [ ] **CONT-01**: User can create posts with text
- [ ] **CONT-02**: User can edit their own posts

[... full list ...]

---

Does this capture what you're building? (yes / adjust)
```

If "adjust": Return to scoping.

**Commit requirements:**

```bash
gsd_run query commit "docs: define v1 requirements" --files .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```

## 7.5. Project Structure Mode

**If auto mode:** Set `PROJECT_MODE=mvp` and skip this prompt.

**Mode prompt: Vertical MVP vs Horizontal Layers.**

Ask the user how they want to structure the project. Use `AskUserQuestion` with two options:

- **Vertical MVP** — get a working app fast, add features slice by slice. Each phase delivers an end-to-end user capability. *(Recommended for new products and rapid-iteration MVPs.)*
- **Horizontal Layers** — build complete technical layers (DB → API → UI → wiring) and assemble at the end. *(Better for infrastructure-heavy projects with multiple developers.)*

Set `PROJECT_MODE=mvp` if the user picks Vertical MVP, otherwise `PROJECT_MODE=standard`.

When `TEXT_MODE=true` (per the workflow's existing TEXT_MODE handling for non-the agent runtimes), present the same two options as a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number.

## 8. Create Roadmap

Display stage banner:

```
### GSD ► CREATING ROADMAP

◆ Spawning roadmapper... (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze)
```

**ROADMAP.md template — mode-aware emit.** When generating the initial ROADMAP.md:

- If `PROJECT_MODE=mvp`: under each `### Phase N:` header, emit `**Mode:** mvp` on the line immediately following `**Goal:**`. This sets every initial phase to MVP mode (per Phase-4-Persistence decision: per-phase mode, not project-wide config).
- If `PROJECT_MODE=standard`: emit the standard ROADMAP.md template with no `**Mode:**` lines (Horizontal Layers standard template — no behavioral change for users who pick Horizontal Layers).

Example MVP-mode emit for Phase 1:

```markdown
### Phase 1: [Name]
**Goal:** [Goal]
**Mode:** mvp
**Success Criteria**:
1. [Criterion]
```

Pass `PROJECT_MODE` to the roadmapper so it applies the correct template.

Spawn gsd-roadmapper agent with path references:

5. Write files immediately (ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability)
6. Return ROADMAP CREATED with summary
