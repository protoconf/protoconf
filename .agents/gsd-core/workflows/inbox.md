<purpose>
Triage and review all open GitHub issues and PRs against project contribution templates.
Produces a structured report showing compliance status for each item, flags missing
required fields, identifies label gaps, and optionally takes action (label, comment, close).

<required_reading>
Before starting, read these project files to understand the review criteria:
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` — required fields for feature issues

**If `response_language` is set:** All user-facing output of this workflow — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, findings, questions, prompts, and explanations — MUST be presented in `{response_language}`. Technical terms, code, file paths, and subagent prompts stay in English — only user-facing output is translated.

<step name="preflight">
Verify prerequisites:

1. **`gh` CLI available and authenticated?**
   ```bash
   which gh && gh auth status 2>&1
   ```
   If not available: print setup instructions and exit.

2. **Detect repository:**
   If `--repo` flag provided, use that. Otherwise:
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner' 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If no repo detected: error — must be in a git repo with a GitHub remote.

3. **Parse flags:**
   - `--issues` → set REVIEW_ISSUES=true, REVIEW_PRS=false
   - `--prs` → set REVIEW_ISSUES=false, REVIEW_PRS=true
   - `--label` → set AUTO_LABEL=true
   - `--close-incomplete` → set AUTO_CLOSE=true
   - Default (no flags): review both issues and PRs, report only (no auto-actions)
</step>

<step name="fetch_issues">
Skip if REVIEW_ISSUES=false.

Fetch all open issues:
```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,body,author,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 100
```

For each issue, classify by labels and body content:

| Label/Pattern | Type | Template |
|---|---|---|
| `feature-request` | Feature | feature_request.yml |
| `enhancement` | Enhancement | enhancement.yml |
| `bug` | Bug | bug_report.yml |
| `type: chore` | Chore | chore.yml |
| No matching label | Unknown | Flag for manual triage |

If an issue has no type label, attempt to classify from the body content:
- Contains "### Feature name" → likely Feature
- Contains "### What existing feature" → likely Enhancement
- Contains "### What happened?" → likely Bug
- Contains "### What is the maintenance task?" → likely Chore
- Cannot determine → mark as `needs-triage`

**Scoring:** Same as issues — completeness percentage per PR.
</step>

<step name="check_gates">
Cross-reference issues and PRs to enforce the issue-first rule:

For each open PR:
1. Extract linked issue number from body
2. If no linked issue: **GATE VIOLATION** — PR has no issue
3. If linked issue exists, check its labels:
   - Feature PR → issue must have `approved-feature`
   - Enhancement PR → issue must have `approved-enhancement`
   - Fix PR → issue must have `confirmed-bug`
4. If label is missing: **GATE VIOLATION** — PR opened before approval

Report gate violations prominently — these are the most important findings because
the project auto-closes PRs without proper approval gates.

Produce a structured triage report:

{For each violation:}

    Problem: {description — e.g., "No approved-feature label on linked issue #45"}
    Action:  {what to do — e.g., "Close PR or approve issue #45 first"}

Write this report to `.planning/INBOX-TRIAGE.md` if a `.planning/` directory exists,
otherwise print to console only.
</step>

<step name="auto_actions">
Only execute if `--label` or `--close-incomplete` flags were set.

**If --label:**
For each issue/PR where labels are missing or incorrect:
```bash
gh issue edit {number} --add-label "{label}"
```
Or:
```bash
gh pr edit {number} --add-label "{label}"
```

Label recommendations:
- Unclassified issues → add `needs-triage`
- Feature issues without review → add `needs-review`
- Enhancement issues without review → add `needs-review`
- Bug reports without triage → add `needs-triage`
- PRs with gate violations → add `gate-violation`

**If --close-incomplete:**
For issues scoring below 50% completeness:
```bash
gh issue close {number} --comment "Closed by GSD inbox triage: this issue is missing required fields per the issue template. Missing: {list}. Please reopen with a complete submission. See CONTRIBUTING.md for requirements."
```

For PRs with gate violations:
```bash
gh pr close {number} --comment "Closed by GSD inbox triage: this PR does not meet the issue-first requirement. {specific violation}. See CONTRIBUTING.md for the correct process."
```

Always confirm with the user before closing anything:

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number. This is required for non-the agent runtimes (OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) where `AskUserQuestion` is not available.

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Found {N} items to close. Review the list above — proceed with closing?"
  options:
    - label: "Close all"
      description: "Close all {N} non-compliant items with explanation comments"
    - label: "Let me pick"
      description: "I'll choose which ones to close"
    - label: "Skip"
      description: "Don't close anything — report only"
```
