**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number. This is required for non-the agent runtimes (OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) where `AskUserQuestion` is not available.

**Non-the agent runtime note:** If `TEXT_MODE` is active (i.e. the runtime is non-the agent), prepend the following notice before the model profile question:

```
Note: Quality, Balanced, Budget, and Adaptive profiles assign semantic tiers
(Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) to each agent. When `runtime` is set in .planning/config.json,
tiers resolve to runtime-native model IDs — on Codex that's gpt-5.6-sol / gpt-5.6-terra /
gpt-5.6-luna with appropriate reasoning effort. See "Runtime-Aware Profiles" in
docs/CONFIGURATION.md.

If `runtime` is unset on a non-the agent runtime, the profile tiers have no effect on
actual model selection — agents use the runtime's default model. Choose "Inherit" to
force session-model behavior, set `runtime` + a profile to get tiered models, or
configure `model_overrides` manually in .planning/config.json to target specific
models per agent.
```

**Isolation resolution for the Worktrees question (#2486):** resolve the runtime's declared executor-isolation primitive and the current worktrees value before presenting the questions. Use `inspect-dispatch-isolation`, the **sentinel-free** inspection verb — never `dispatch-isolation`, whose #3045 contract records the resolved decision to the executor-dispatch sentinel as an unconditional side effect; a settings menu must not be able to stamp a sentinel the isolation guards then enforce against real dispatches. Sentinel-free is the exact claim: the shared CLI bootstrap still runs, but nothing it does can block a dispatch. The worktrees read deliberately carries no `--default`/fallback: an absent key must stay distinguishable from an explicit `false` (empty output = key absent), which the pre-selection rule below depends on.

A failed query is not a capability verdict, so track the two apart: settings still fails closed, but
says so instead of claiming the runtime declares no primitive. The verb fail-closes an unknown runtime — or an
internal resolution error — to `none` and exits 0, so `INSPECTED_RESOLVED=false` means only "the query did not answer"
(#2486 review):

```bash
_INSPECTED_RAW=$(gsd_run query inspect-dispatch-isolation --raw 2>/dev/null)
_ISOLATION_RC=$?
if [ $_ISOLATION_RC -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$_INSPECTED_RAW" ]; then
  INSPECTED_ISOLATION=none
  INSPECTED_RESOLVED=false      # no verdict learned — not the same as "declares none"
else
  INSPECTED_ISOLATION="$_INSPECTED_RAW"
  INSPECTED_RESOLVED=true
fi
case "$INSPECTED_ISOLATION" in
  harness-worktree|orchestrator-worktree|none) ;;
  *) INSPECTED_ISOLATION=none; INSPECTED_RESOLVED=false ;;   # out of vocabulary is not a verdict either
esac
USE_WORKTREES_CURRENT=$(gsd_run query config-get workflow.use_worktrees --raw 2>/dev/null)

### Execution
Verifier, TDD Mode, Code Review, Code Review Depth _(conditional — only when code_review=on)_, UI Review

### Docs & Output
Commit Docs, Skip Discuss, Worktrees

### Features
Intel, Graphify, Graph auto-update _(conditional — only when graphify=on)_

### Model & Pipeline
Model Profile, Auto-Advance, Branching

### Misc
Context Warnings, Research Qs

**Conditional visibility — code_review_depth:** This question is shown only when the user's chosen `code_review` value (after they answer that question, or the pre-selected value if unchanged) is on. If `code_review` is off, omit the `code_review_depth` question from the AskUserQuestion block and preserve the existing `workflow.code_review_depth` value in config (do not overwrite). Implementation: ask the Model + Planning + Execution-up-to-Code-Review questions first; if `code_review=on`, include `code_review_depth` in the same batch; otherwise skip it. Conceptually this is a one-branch split on the `code_review` answer.

**Conditional visibility — graphify.auto_update:** This question is shown only when the user's chosen `graphify.enabled` value is on. If `graphify.enabled` is off, omit the `graphify.auto_update` question and preserve the existing `graphify.auto_update` value in config (do not overwrite). Implementation: ask Graphify first; only ask Graph auto-update when Graphify is enabled.

**Conditional options — Worktrees (#2486):** whether a runtime can honor `workflow.use_worktrees: true` depends on its **declared `dispatch.isolation` capability, not its name** (#2584): `harness-worktree` (the host isolates each executor) and `orchestrator-worktree` (GSD drives the worktrees) both run parallel; `none` fails closed on an explicit `true`. Branch on the same negotiation the execution gate resolves, via the sentinel-free `inspect-dispatch-isolation` verb, which fail-closes unknown/undeclared/`undocumented` to `none`. The rule is one-directional: **never persist a value the isolation gate would fail closed on.** **Do not add a runtime-name test here.** Branch on `$INSPECTED_ISOLATION`:

- **If `INSPECTED_ISOLATION` ≠ `none`** (`harness-worktree` or `orchestrator-worktree`): present the Worktrees question exactly as written below — unchanged behavior. The `none` branch is the entirety of the #2486 change.
- **If `INSPECTED_ISOLATION` = `none`:** replace the question's options with the two below — do NOT offer an enabling option, and NEVER write `workflow.use_worktrees: true` from this workflow when the runtime declares no isolation primitive, regardless of the user's answer:

```
{
  question: "Use git worktrees for parallel agent isolation?",
  header: "Worktrees",
  multiSelect: false,
  options: [
    { label: "No (Recommended)", description: "Write use_worktrees: false. {FINDING}, so parallel plans run sequentially and {CONSEQUENCE}." },
    { label: "Leave unchanged", description: "Do not write the key. {ABSENCE}; an existing explicit value is kept intact (e.g. for a worktree-capable install sharing this config)." }
  ]
}
```

**The three placeholders** carry the only difference between a capability GSD resolved and one it could not, so no text in this branch ever asserts a verdict that was not reached. Substitute them everywhere they appear — the two `description`s above, the pre-selection rationale, and the notice — from whichever column applies:

| | `INSPECTED_RESOLVED=true` | `INSPECTED_RESOLVED=false` |
|---|---|---|
| `{FINDING}` | this runtime has no usable executor-isolation primitive | GSD could not resolve this runtime's executor-isolation capability |
| `{CONSEQUENCE}` | execution fails closed on an explicit true | GSD cannot tell whether execution will accept an explicit true |
| `{ABSENCE}` | absent, it resolves to false wherever this emit stamped that default | absent, it is the safe state until the capability resolves |

Failing closed is right in both columns — never write `workflow.use_worktrees: true` from this branch either way. Only the explanation changes.

  Persistence: "No (Recommended)" → write `workflow.use_worktrees: false`; "Leave unchanged" → do not write `workflow.use_worktrees` at all (preserve the existing value or absence).

  Pre-selection: the generic "current values pre-selected" rule does not apply when `INSPECTED_ISOLATION` is `none` — an explicit `true` has no matching option by design. Pre-select "No (Recommended)" in every case, including an absent key (`$USE_WORKTREES_CURRENT` empty, the no-`--default` read's absent signal): absence resolves to `false` only where this emit stamped that default and to `true` otherwise, so leaving it absent can preserve the very state this branch prevents, while an explicit `false` is correct under either emit (#2486 review). The same applies when it is an explicit non-false value — the broken-inheritance case the notice below covers. "Leave unchanged" remains available for the deliberate shared-config case, but is never the default here. The default must be the repair the "(Recommended)" label points to, so accepting it never keeps a value this branch could not justify. In TEXT_MODE, mark that option as the default in the numbered list.

  Additionally, if `$USE_WORKTREES_CURRENT` is non-empty and not `false` (the config carries an explicit `true` — e.g. inherited from a worktree-capable install sharing the repo; empty means the key is absent, which needs no notice), prepend this notice before the question:

```
Note: the project config currently sets workflow.use_worktrees: true.
{FINDING}, so {CONSEQUENCE}. Choose "No" to repair it for this runtime, or
"Leave unchanged" to keep it for a worktree-capable install that shares this
config.
```

<step name="update_config">

```json

  ...existing_config,
  "model_profile": "quality" | "balanced" | "budget" | "adaptive" | "inherit",
  "commit_docs": true/false,

  },
  "intel": {
    "enabled": true/false
  },
  "graphify": {
    "enabled": true/false,
    "auto_update": true/false
  },
  "git": {
    "branching_strategy": "none" | "phase" | "milestone",

    "create_tag": true/false
  },
  "hooks": {
    "context_warnings": true/false,
    "workflow_guard": true/false
  },
  "model_policy": {
    // Read-only in this flow — written only by /gsd-config --advanced (Section 8).
    // Listed here so safe-merge never clobbers an existing model_policy object.
    "provider": <existing|null>,
    "budget": <existing|null>,
    "high": <existing|null>,
    "medium": <existing|null>,
    "low": <existing|null>
  }
}
```

**Safe merge:** Apply each chosen value so unrelated keys are never clobbered. Use the appropriate write path per key:

- **Capability hook-gate keys** (owned by a capability in the registry — see `registry.configSchema`): write via the capability writer:
  ```bash
  gsd_run capability set <owner> --gate <key>=<value> [--config-dir "$RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR"]
  ```
  The capability-owned keys written by this workflow and their owners are:
  | Key | Owner capability |
  |---|---|
  | `workflow.research` | `research` |
  | `workflow.nyquist_validation` | `nyquist` |
  | `workflow.pattern_mapper` | `pattern-mapper` |
  | `workflow.ui_phase` | `ui` |
  | `workflow.ui_safety_gate` | `ui` |
  | `workflow.ai_integration_phase` | `ai-integration` |
  | `workflow.tdd_mode` | `tdd` |
  | `workflow.code_review` | `code-review` |
  | `workflow.code_review_depth` | `code-review` |
  | `workflow.ui_review` | `ui` |
  | `intel.enabled` | `intel` |
  | `graphify.enabled` | `graphify` |

  `code_review_depth` is written only if the `code_review` question was answered `on`; otherwise leave the existing value in place.

- **Non-capability keys** (`model_profile`, `commit_docs`, `workflow.plan_check`, `workflow.verifier`, `workflow.auto_advance`, `workflow.text_mode`, `workflow.research_before_questions`, `workflow.discuss_mode`, `workflow.skip_discuss`, `workflow.use_worktrees`, `plan_review.source_grounding`, `graphify.auto_update`, `git.*`, `hooks.*`, `model_policy.*`): write via `gsd_run query config-set <key.path> <value>` as before.

`model_profile` is written on Q1 "Adaptive (Recommended)" (→ adaptive) or Q1 "Inherit" (→ inherit) immediately; for Q1 "Standard tier…", `model_profile` is written from Q2's answer. If Q1 = "Standard tier…" but Q2 is cancelled, leave the existing `model_profile` value unchanged — do not write any new value.

Write updated config to `$GSD_CONFIG_PATH` (the workstream-aware path resolved in `ensure_and_load_config`). Never hardcode `.planning/config.json` — workstream installs route to `.planning/workstreams/<slug>/config.json`.
</step>

<step name="save_as_defaults">
Ask whether to save these settings as global defaults for future projects:

```
AskUserQuestion([
  {
    question: "Save these as default settings for all new projects?",
    header: "Defaults",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Yes", description: "New projects start with these settings (saved to ~/.gsd/defaults.json)" },
      { label: "No", description: "Only apply to this project" }
    ]
  }
])
```

If "Yes": write the same config object (minus project-specific fields like `brave_search`) to `~/.gsd/defaults.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gsd
```

Write `~/.gsd/defaults.json` with:
```json

| Context Warnings     | {On/Off} |
| Saved as Defaults    | {Yes/No} |

These settings apply to future /gsd-plan-phase and /gsd-execute-phase runs.

Quick commands:
- /gsd-config --integrations — configure API keys (Brave/Firecrawl/Exa), review.models CLI routing, and agent_skills injection
- /gsd-config --profile <profile> — switch model profile
- /gsd-plan-phase --research — force research
- /gsd-plan-phase --skip-research — skip research
- /gsd-plan-phase --skip-verify — skip plan check
- /gsd-config --advanced — power-user tuning (plan bounce, timeouts, branch templates, cross-AI, context window, model policy)
```
</step>

</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Current config read
- [ ] User presented with 24 settings (profile + workflow toggles + features + git branching + git tagging + ctx warnings), grouped into six sections: Planning, Execution, Docs & Output, Features, Model & Pipeline, Misc. `code_review_depth` is conditional on `code_review=on`. Model profile uses a two-question split (Q1: Adaptive / Standard tier / Inherit; Q2: Quality / Balanced / Budget — only when Standard tier chosen) to stay within the 4-option AskUserQuestion cap while exposing all 5 valid profiles (#3784). Drift Guard (`plan_review.source_grounding`) is in the Planning section.
- [ ] Config updated with model_profile, workflow, and git sections
- [ ] User offered to save as global defaults (~/.gsd/defaults.json)
- [ ] Changes confirmed to user
