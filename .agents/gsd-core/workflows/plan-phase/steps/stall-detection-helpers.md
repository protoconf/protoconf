# Bounded Stall-Detection Helpers (#2650)

Every planner/plan-checker spawn in `plan-phase.md` dispatches with
`run_in_background=true`, records `TS=$(date +%s)`, and then repeatedly
calls `gsd_stall_watch` until it returns something other than
`waiting`/`active`. This mirrors the already-shipped `executor.stall_*`
pattern (`execute-phase.md`, bug #3212, commit `e7942c21b`) but — unlike
that prose-only surveillance, which cannot run during a *blocking* `Agent()`
call — each `gsd_stall_watch` call is a real, bounded bash subprocess wait
issued as its own tool call, so it returns control to the orchestrator on
its own schedule regardless of whether the backgrounded agent's own
completion notification ever arrives.

**Binding `{outputFile}` (load-bearing, not optional):** every `gsd_stall_watch`
call below takes `{outputFile}` as its second argument — a literal token the
orchestrator must substitute with the REAL path from the immediately preceding
`run_in_background=true` Agent() call's returned `async_launched` result,
exactly as `docs-update.md:471` already does ("Read tool: file_path: `{outputFile
from README agent result}`"). This is NOT a bash variable the snippet below
assigns — there is nothing upstream that assigns one, so a bash variable
reference here would silently stay empty forever. With `{outputFile}` correctly
substituted, `[ -f "$output_file" ]` can find the real file and the
`marker_received` path is reachable; left as a literal (or as an unbound bash
variable), `marker_found` can never become `true` and every spawn silently
falls back to the mtime-only path — for the plan-checker spawn specifically,
that fallback is broken (see next paragraph), so binding this correctly there
is not a nice-to-have.

**Plan-checker's artifact glob needs the marker, not just mtimes:** the
plan-checker spawn watches `*-PLAN.md` for freshness, but a checker that
PASSES touches none of those files — no fresh mtime, ever, on a clean run.
Without `{outputFile}` correctly bound to the real completion output, a
healthy plan-checker that returns `## VERIFICATION PASSED` in two minutes
would still be declared `stalled` once `planner.stall_threshold_minutes`
elapses — reporting a succeeded agent as hung, which is worse than the
original unbounded wait. The marker path (via `{outputFile}`) is the ONLY
working completion signal for that spawn; the artifact glob is secondary
there.

**Single-cycle by design, not one long-lived loop:** `gsd_stall_watch` sleeps
for exactly one `PLANNER_STALL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` and returns — it does NOT
loop internally for the full `PLANNER_STALL_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`. A single Bash
tool call blocking for `threshold + interval` minutes (up to 15 min at
defaults) risks the *host tool's own* timeout killing the call before it ever
prints a result — silently defeating the fix it exists to ship. Looping at
the orchestrator-prose level instead means every cycle is a short (default 5
min), real, bounded call that reliably hands control back — the outer
threshold is enforced by `dispatch_ts` accumulating across calls, not by one
call's own duration.

**Never a wake-up call between cycles (#4079):** while the orchestrator waits
between `gsd_stall_watch` cycles, it must NOT call `ScheduleWakeup` (or any
host wake/sleep-scheduling tool, e.g. the `/loop` pacing surface) to
literalize "I'll wait". The `gsd_stall_watch` bash call IS the wait mechanism;
wake-up scheduling is never part of it, and a partial-args `ScheduleWakeup`
call surfaces the host's red validation error (`prompt` is required when
`stop` is not true). Just issue the next watch call (or let the blocking
Agent() return) — nothing else.

**Disclosed tradeoff:** the first cycle always sleeps a full
`PLANNER_STALL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` before its first check, so a planner that
completes in seconds is not observed by this path until that interval
elapses (default 5 min) — slower than a plain blocking call's near-instant
return on success. This is deliberate: it trades a bounded, at-most-one-
interval delay on the (common) success path for eliminating the unbounded,
possibly-indefinite hang on the (rare, previously unrecoverable) stall path
this issue is about. `PLANNER_STALL_INTERVAL_MINUTES` is the knob for
projects that want a tighter success-path latency at the cost of more
config-get calls.

This block is independent of, and never gated behind, the `query
teams-status` / `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` guard used for the
researcher spawn — the stall path applies on every runtime, teams-active or
not (AC2).
