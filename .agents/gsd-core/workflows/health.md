```

**If `response_language` is set:** All user-facing output of this workflow — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, findings, questions, prompts, and explanations — MUST be presented in `{response_language}`. Technical terms, code, file paths, and subagent prompts stay in English — only user-facing output is translated.

<step name="parse_args">
**Parse arguments:**

Check if `--repair`, `--backfill`, or `--context` flags are present in the command arguments.

```
REPAIR_FLAG=""
BACKFILL_FLAG=""
CONTEXT_MODE=""
if arguments contain "--repair"; then
  REPAIR_FLAG="--repair"
fi
if arguments contain "--backfill"; then
  BACKFILL_FLAG="--backfill"
fi
if arguments contain "--context"; then
  CONTEXT_MODE="true"
fi
```

If `CONTEXT_MODE` is set, jump to the `context_check` step and skip the
integrity validation steps. The two modes are orthogonal — context utilization
has nothing to do with `.planning/` directory health.
</step>

<step name="context_check">
**Run only when `--context` is set.**

The model running this workflow self-reports the current session's
approximate `tokensUsed` and the active model's `contextWindow`. Use the values
visible in your runtime (Claude Code's `/context` slash command output, or the
model's own session telemetry). If the runtime exposes neither, prompt the user
once via AskUserQuestion for both numbers.

**TEXT_MODE fallback:** when `text_mode` is true (config or `--text` flag) the
runtime is non-the agent (Codex, Gemini, etc.) and `AskUserQuestion` is not
available — replace the prompt with a plain-text two-question sequence
("Approximate tokens used? Context window size?") and read the answers as
plain text from the user's response.

```bash
gsd_run query validate.context \
  --tokens-used "$TOKENS_USED" \
  --context-window "$CONTEXT_WINDOW"
```

The query prints a one-line status (`Context utilization: NN% (state)`) plus
a recommendation line for the warning and critical states. Print the SDK
output verbatim and end the workflow — do **not** mix in `.planning/`
health output, the two modes are independent diagnostics.
</step>

<step name="run_health_check">
**Run health validation:**

```bash
gsd_run query validate.health $REPAIR_FLAG $BACKFILL_FLAG
```

Parse JSON output:
- `status`: "healthy" | "degraded" | "broken"
- `errors[]`: Critical issues (code, message, fix, repairable)
- `warnings[]`: Non-critical issues
- `info[]`: Informational notes
- `repairable_count`: Number of auto-fixable issues
- `repairs_performed[]`: Actions taken if --repair was used

**Isolation/worktrees compatibility check (#2486):** the SDK is runtime-neutral, so this check runs here, using the same negotiation the execution-workflow guards use. It catches a config that carries an explicit `workflow.use_worktrees: true` on a runtime whose declared `dispatch.isolation` is `none` (e.g. inherited from a worktree-capable install sharing the repo) — a value `/gsd-execute-phase` and `/gsd-quick` fail closed on. The gate is the **declared capability, not the runtime name** (#2584), and the resolver fail-closes unknown/undeclared/`undocumented` values to `none`. Use `inspect-dispatch-isolation`, the **sentinel-free** inspection verb — never `dispatch-isolation`, whose #3045 contract records the resolved decision to the executor-dispatch sentinel as an unconditional side effect; a read-only diagnostic must not be able to stamp a sentinel the isolation guards then enforce against real dispatches. "Sentinel-free" is the precise claim and the only one this check depends on: like every `gsd-tools` invocation, inspection still runs the shared CLI bootstrap, which may self-heal a stale `.planning/active-workstream` pointer or rebuild compiled modules. Those are pre-existing, verb-independent, and cannot block a dispatch; writing the sentinel can:

The worktrees read deliberately carries no `--default`/fallback, exactly as `settings.md` does
it: W025's claim is that the config **sets** the key to a non-false value, so an absent key
(empty output) must stay distinguishable from an explicit `true`. A `|| echo "true"` fallback
collapses that distinction and makes the check fire on a config that never set the key —
correct only on an emit where `_stampNonClaudeRuntimeDefaults` happened to rewrite the line to
`--default false`, and wrong on the un-stamped source/the agent emit. The `[ -n … ]` guard below
removes that dependency on stamping entirely (#2486 review, Major 1).

A failed query is **not** a capability verdict. `|| echo "none"` would collapse "this runtime
declares no primitive" and "the query did not answer" into the same value, and W025's text asserts
the former — telling a Claude Code user their runtime declares no executor-isolation primitive,
which is false. Track the two apart and report which one happened.

Know the limit of that signal (#2486 review): the verb itself fail-closes an unknown, undeclared or
out-of-vocabulary runtime — and any internal resolution error — to `none` and exits 0, so `INSPECTED_RESOLVED=true` means "the query
answered", not "the runtime published a declaration". W025's resolved-case wording below is
therefore written to be true of every path that reaches it — a declared `none` and an
internally-fail-closed `none` alike. Distinguishing those two would need the verb to report
provenance, which is out of scope here.

```bash
_INSPECTED_RAW=$(gsd_run query inspect-dispatch-isolation --raw 2>/dev/null)
_ISOLATION_RC=$?
if [ $_ISOLATION_RC -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$_INSPECTED_RAW" ]; then
  INSPECTED_ISOLATION=none
  INSPECTED_RESOLVED=false      # no verdict learned — not the same as "declares none"
else
  INSPECTED_ISOLATION="$_INSPECTED_RAW"
  INSPECTED_RESOLVED=true
fi
case "$INSPECTED_ISOLATION" in
  harness-worktree|orchestrator-worktree|none) ;;
  *) INSPECTED_ISOLATION=none; INSPECTED_RESOLVED=false ;;   # out of vocabulary is not a verdict either
esac

USE_WORKTREES=$(gsd_run query config-get workflow.use_worktrees --raw 2>/dev/null)
if [ "$INSPECTED_ISOLATION" = "none" ] && [ -n "$USE_WORKTREES" ] && [ "$USE_WORKTREES" != "false" ]; then
  if [ "$INSPECTED_RESOLVED" = "true" ]; then
    echo "W025: the project config sets workflow.use_worktrees to a non-false value, but this runtime has no usable executor-isolation primitive — dispatch.isolation resolves to none, declared as none, or fail-closed because the capability could not be determined — so /gsd-execute-phase and /gsd-quick will fail closed. Fix: run /gsd-settings and answer No to Worktrees, or set workflow.use_worktrees: false in the project config (the active workstream's config.json when one is active). Set it explicitly rather than deleting the key — an absent key resolves to false only on an emit whose default was stamped to false, and to true otherwise."
  else
    echo "W025: the project config sets workflow.use_worktrees to a non-false value, and GSD could not resolve this runtime's executor-isolation capability ('gsd_run query inspect-dispatch-isolation' failed or returned nothing) — so it cannot tell whether /gsd-execute-phase and /gsd-quick will fail closed on that value. This is a report of an unverifiable config, NOT a finding that the runtime declares no primitive. Fix: re-run once the gsd-tools shim resolves; if the warning persists, run /gsd-settings and answer No to Worktrees."
  fi
fi
```

If the check prints, append it to the Warnings section of the report as `[W025]` with the printed fix, include it in the displayed warning count, and report `Status: DEGRADED` if `validate.health` returned `healthy` (a config the execution workflows fail closed on is not a healthy planning state). It is not auto-repairable: an explicit `true` may be intentional for a worktree-capable install sharing the same `.planning/config.json`, so the remedy is the user's call (#2486).

Note: this table is **generated** — do not hand-edit it. It is produced by `node scripts/gen-health-docs.cjs --write` from `src/health-diagnostic.cts`'s `RULES` table (31 rules as of #3309, each carrying a static `description`/`repairable` on its `Rule` entry — see `src/health-diagnostic-types.cts`) plus the 3 pre-checks that stay outside the rule table by design (`E001`, `E010`, `I010` — safety rails in `cmdValidateHealth`, `src/verify.cts`, never `.planning/` findings). `scripts/lint-health-diagnostic-rule-table.cjs` already enforces the 1:1 code invariant this table depends on (no duplicate codes; severity is always a `Rule` property, never set per emit call) — before assigning a new code, add a `Rule` entry under `src/health-diagnostic-rules/` (its `code` is simply the next free number the lint guard has not yet seen) and run `node scripts/gen-health-docs.cjs --write` to regenerate this table; `npm run lint:generated-sync` fails if it drifts. `W025` (the `workflow.use_worktrees`/`dispatch.isolation` check, #2486) is a workflow-layer diagnostic emitted directly by this file's own `run_health_check` step, not by `cmdValidateHealth` — it stays documented in that step, not in this generated table.
