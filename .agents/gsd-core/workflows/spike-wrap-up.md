### GSD ► SPIKE WRAP-UP
```
</step>

<step name="gather">
## Gather Spike Inventory

1. Read `.planning/spikes/MANIFEST.md` for the `## Ideas` sections (each idea's paragraph and
   its own scoped Requirements list) and the `## Spikes` table (its Idea column tells you which
   idea key each spike row belongs to).
2. Glob `.planning/spikes/*/README.md` and parse YAML frontmatter from each — each spike's
   `idea:` field is the idea key that owns it. If a README predates #1700 and has no `idea:`
   field, resolve its idea key from the matching `## Spikes` table row's Idea column instead.
3. Check if `./.agents/skills/spike-findings-*/SKILL.md` exists for this project
   - If yes: read its `processed_spikes` list from the metadata section and filter those out
   - If no: all spikes are candidates

If no unprocessed spikes exist:
```
No unprocessed spikes found in `.planning/spikes/`.
Run `/gsd-spike` first to create experiments.
```
Exit.

Check `commit_docs` config:
```bash
_GSD_SHIM_NAME="gsd-tools.cjs"; _GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT="${RUNTIME_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"; GSD_TOOLS="${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; _gsd_at() { for _p; do if [ -f "$_p" ]; then GSD_TOOLS="$_p"; return 0; fi; done; return 1; }; if _gsd_at "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.agents/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.codex/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif unset -f gsd_run; _G="$(command -v gsd_run)"; then GSD_TOOLS="$_G"; gsd_run() { "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif _gsd_at "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cursor}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.copilot}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codeium/windsurf}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.augment}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${TRAE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.trae}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${QWEN_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.qwen}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codebuddy}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CLINE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cline}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GROK_AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini/antigravity}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/opencode}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${KILO_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/kilo}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; else echo "ERROR: gsd-tools.cjs not found at $GSD_TOOLS and gsd_run is not on PATH.

```
</step>

<step name="auto_include">
## Auto-Include All Spikes

Include all unprocessed spikes automatically. Present a brief inventory showing what's being processed:

```
Processing N spikes:
  001 — name (VALIDATED)
  002 — name (PARTIAL)
  003 — name (INVALIDATED)
```

Every spike carries forward:
- **VALIDATED** spikes provide proven patterns
- **PARTIAL** spikes provide constrained patterns
- **INVALIDATED** spikes provide landmines and dead ends
</step>

<step name="group">
## Auto-Group by Feature Area

Group spikes by feature area based on tags, names, `related` fields, and content. Proceed directly into synthesis.

Each group becomes one reference file in the generated skill.
</step>

<step name="skill_name">
## Determine Output Skill Name

Derive the skill name from the project directory:

1. Get the project root directory name (e.g., `solana-tracker`)
2. The skill will be created at `./.agents/skills/spike-findings-[project-dir-name]/`

If a skill already exists at that path (append mode), update in place.
</step>

<step name="copy_sources">
## Copy Source Files

For each included spike:

1. Identify the core source files — the actual scripts, main files, and config that make the spike work. Exclude:
   - `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, build artifacts
   - Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, etc.)
   - `.git/`, `.DS_Store`
2. Copy the README.md and core source files into `sources/NNN-spike-name/` inside the generated skill directory
</step>

<step name="synthesize">
## Synthesize Reference Files

For each feature-area group, write a reference file at `references/[feature-area-name].md` as an **implementation blueprint** — it should read like a recipe, not a research paper. A future build session should be able to follow this and build the feature correctly without re-spiking anything.

```markdown
# [Feature Area Name]

## Requirements

[Non-negotiable design decisions pulled ONLY from the Requirements list of the idea key(s) that
own the spikes in this feature-area group — match each spike's `idea:` frontmatter (or Idea
column) to its `### {idea-key}` Requirements list in MANIFEST.md. These MUST be honored in the
real build. E.g., "Must use streaming JSON output", "Must support reconnection".

Never include a requirement from an idea key that has no spike in this group.]

## How to Build It

[Step-by-step: what to install, how to configure, what code pattern to use. Include key code snippets extracted from the spike source. This is the proven approach — not theory, but tested and working code.]

## What to Avoid

[Things that look right but aren't. Gotchas. Anti-patterns discovered during spiking. Dead ends that were tried and failed.]

## Constraints

[Hard facts: rate limits, library limitations, version requirements, incompatibilities]

## Origin

Synthesized from spikes: NNN, NNN, NNN
Source files available in: sources/NNN-spike-name/, sources/NNN-spike-name/
```
</step>

<step name="write_skill">
## Write SKILL.md

Create (or update) the generated skill's SKILL.md:

```markdown
---
name: spike-findings-[project-dir-name]
description: Implementation blueprint from spike experiments. Requirements, proven patterns, and verified knowledge for building [project-dir-name]. Auto-loaded during implementation work.
---

<context>
## Project: [project-dir-name]

[One paragraph per idea key represented among the wrapped spikes, taken from that idea's
`### {idea-key}` section in MANIFEST.md — not the whole MANIFEST.md if it holds unrelated ideas.]

Spike sessions wrapped: [date(s)]
</context>

<requirements>
## Requirements

[Union of the Requirements lists for every idea key represented among the spikes being wrapped
in this session — never the whole MANIFEST.md. These are non-negotiable design decisions that
emerged from the user's choices while spiking those specific idea(s). Every feature area
reference must honor these. If this wrap-up spans more than one idea key, group the list by
idea key so a future reader can tell which requirement belongs to which idea.]

- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
</requirements>

<findings_index>
## Feature Areas

| Area | Reference | Key Finding |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| [Name] | references/[name].md | [One-line summary] |

## Source Files

Original spike source files are preserved in `sources/` for complete reference.
</findings_index>

<metadata>
## Processed Spikes

[List of spike numbers wrapped up]

- 001-spike-name
- 002-spike-name
</metadata>
```
</step>

<step name="write_summary">
## Write Planning Summary

Write `.planning/spikes/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md` for project history:

```markdown
# Spike Wrap-Up Summary

**Date:** [date]
**Spikes processed:** [count]
**Feature areas:** [list]
**Skill output:** `./.agents/skills/spike-findings-[project]/`

## Processed Spikes
| # | Name | Type | Verdict | Feature Area |
|---|------|------|---------|--------------|

## Key Findings
[consolidated findings summary]
```
</step>

<step name="update_claude_md">
## Update Project GEMINI.md

Add an auto-load routing line to the project's GEMINI.md (create the file if it doesn't exist):

```
- **Spike findings for [project]** (implementation patterns, constraints, gotchas) → `Skill("spike-findings-[project-dir-name]")`
```

If this routing line already exists (append mode), leave it as-is.
</step>

<step name="generate_conventions">
## Generate or Update CONVENTIONS.md

Analyze all processed spikes for recurring patterns and write `.planning/spikes/CONVENTIONS.md`. This file tells future spike sessions *how we spike* — the stack, structure, and patterns that have been established.

1. Read all spike source code and READMEs looking for:
   - **Stack choices** — What language/framework/runtime appears across multiple spikes?
   - **Structure patterns** — Common file layouts, port numbers, naming schemes
   - **Recurring approaches** — How auth is handled, how styling is done, how data is served
   - **Tools & libraries** — Packages that showed up repeatedly with versions that worked

2. Write or update `.planning/spikes/CONVENTIONS.md`:

```markdown
# Spike Conventions

Patterns and stack choices established across spike sessions. New spikes follow these unless the question requires otherwise.

## Stack
[What we use for frontend, backend, scripts, and why — derived from what repeated across spikes]

## Structure
[Common file layouts, port assignments, naming patterns]

## Patterns
[Recurring approaches: how we handle auth, how we style, how we serve, etc.]

## Tools & Libraries
[Preferred packages with versions that worked, and any to avoid]
```

3. Only include patterns that appeared in 2+ spikes or were explicitly chosen by the user.

4. If `CONVENTIONS.md` already exists (append mode), update sections with new patterns. Remove entries contradicted by newer spikes.
</step>

<step name="commit">
Commit all artifacts (if `COMMIT_DOCS` is true):

```bash
gsd_run query commit "docs(spike-wrap-up): package [N] spike findings into project skill" --files .planning/spikes/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md .planning/spikes/CONVENTIONS.md
```
</step>

<step name="report">

## ▶ Next Up

**Explore frontier spikes** — see what else is worth spiking based on what we've learned

`/gsd-spike` (run with no argument — its frontier mode analyzes the spike landscape and proposes integration and frontier spikes)

---

**Also available:**
- `/gsd-plan-phase` — start planning the real implementation
- `/gsd-spike [idea]` — spike a specific new idea
- `/gsd-explore` — continue exploring
