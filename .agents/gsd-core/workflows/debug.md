# Debug Workflow

Invoked by `/gsd-debug` (`commands/gsd/debug.md`).

Systematic debugging using the scientific method with subagent isolation.
Orchestrates symptom gathering, session creation, and delegation to `gsd-debug-session-manager`.

<available_agent_types>
Valid GSD subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- gsd-debug-session-manager — manages debug checkpoint/continuation loop in isolated context
- gsd-debugger — investigates bugs using scientific method
</available_agent_types>

## 0. Initialize Context

```bash
_GSD_SHIM_NAME="gsd-tools.cjs"; _GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT="${RUNTIME_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"; GSD_TOOLS="${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; _gsd_at() { for _p; do if [ -f "$_p" ]; then GSD_TOOLS="$_p"; return 0; fi; done; return 1; }; if _gsd_at "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.agents/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.codex/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif unset -f gsd_run; _G="$(command -v gsd_run)"; then GSD_TOOLS="$_G"; gsd_run() { "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif _gsd_at "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cursor}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.copilot}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codeium/windsurf}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.augment}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${TRAE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.trae}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${QWEN_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.qwen}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codebuddy}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CLINE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cline}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GROK_AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini/antigravity}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/opencode}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${KILO_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/kilo}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; else echo "ERROR: gsd-tools.cjs not found at $GSD_TOOLS and gsd_run is not on PATH.

One round-trip carries everything this workflow needs (#3149 — this call replaces the former `state.load` + `resolve-model` + `config-get` trio). Extract from init JSON:

- `commit_docs` — whether planning docs are committed.
- `response_language` — TOP-LEVEL field, present ONLY when configured. Absent means English; absence is not a degraded read.
- `debug_dir` — an absolute path anchored on `project_root` (#2376: `debug_file_path` values handed to the spawned `gsd-debug-session-manager` must resolve regardless of that subagent's own cwd, which may differ from the orchestrator's — build them as `{debug_dir}/{slug}.md`, never a bare `.planning/debug/...` literal).
- `debugger_model` — the resolved model for `gsd-debugger` spawns; used as `{debugger_model}` below and governed by the model-omission rule in step 2.
- `tdd_mode` — used as `{TDD_MODE}` in the session parameter blocks below.
- `section_manifest` — `null` today, because this workflow declares no applicability-section markers of its own. **When it is `null`, read this workflow in full.** When it is present, read only the files named in its `read` array. `null` and an empty `included` array are NOT the same: `null` means "no manifest for this workflow", an empty `included` means "nothing applies".

**If `response_language` is set:** All user-facing output of this workflow — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, findings, questions, prompts, and explanations — MUST be presented in `{response_language}`. Technical terms, code, file paths, and subagent prompts stay in English — only user-facing output is translated.

## 1a. LIST subcommand

When SUBCMD=list:

```bash
ls .planning/debug/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v resolved
```

For each file found, parse frontmatter fields (`status`, `trigger`, `updated`) and the `Current Focus` block (`hypothesis`, `next_action`). Display a formatted table:

```
Active Debug Sessions

---
  #  Slug                    Status         Updated
  1  auth-token-null         investigating  2026-04-12
     hypothesis: JWT decode fails when token contains nested claims
     next: Add logging at jwt.verify() call site

  2  form-submit-500         fixing         2026-04-11
     hypothesis: Missing null check on req.body.user
     next: Verify fix passes regression test

---
Run `/gsd-debug continue <slug>` to resume a session.
No sessions? `/gsd-debug <description>` to start.
```

If no files exist or the glob returns nothing: print "No active debug sessions. Run `/gsd-debug <issue description>` to start one."

STOP after displaying list. Do NOT proceed to further steps.

## 1b. STATUS subcommand

When SUBCMD=status and SLUG is set:

**Sanitize SLUG first:** strip whitespace, reject unless it matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`, enforce max 30 chars, reject any `..`, `/`, or `\`. If invalid, print "No debug session found with slug: {SLUG}" and stop.

Check `.planning/debug/{SLUG}.md` exists. If not, check `.planning/debug/resolved/{SLUG}.md`. If neither, print "No debug session found with slug: {SLUG}" and stop.

Parse and print full summary:
- Frontmatter (status, trigger, created, updated)
- Current Focus block (all fields including hypothesis, test, expecting, next_action, reasoning_checkpoint if populated, tdd_checkpoint if populated)
- Count of Evidence entries (lines starting with `- timestamp:` in Evidence section)
- Count of Eliminated entries (lines starting with `- hypothesis:` in Eliminated section)
- Resolution fields (root_cause, fix, verification, files_changed — if any populated)
- TDD checkpoint status (if present)
- Reasoning checkpoint fields (if present)

No agent spawn. Just information display. STOP after printing.

## 1c. CONTINUE subcommand

When SUBCMD=continue and SLUG is set:

**Sanitize SLUG first:** strip whitespace, reject unless it matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`, enforce max 30 chars, reject any `..`, `/`, or `\`. If invalid, print "No active debug session found with slug: {SLUG}. Check `/gsd-debug list` for active sessions." and stop.

Check `.planning/debug/{SLUG}.md` exists. If not, print "No active debug session found with slug: {SLUG}. Check `/gsd-debug list` for active sessions." and stop.

Read file and print Current Focus block to console:

```
Resuming: {SLUG}
Status: {status}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Next action: {next_action}
Evidence entries: {count}
Eliminated: {count}
```

Surface to user. Then delegate directly to the session manager (skip Steps 2 and 3 — pass `symptoms_prefilled: true` and set the slug from SLUG variable). The existing file IS the context.

Print before spawning (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze):
```
[debug] Session: .planning/debug/{SLUG}.md
[debug] Status: {status}
[debug] Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
[debug] Next: {next_action}
[debug] Delegating loop to session manager...
```

Spawn session manager:

> **Model omission (#2517).** Omit the `model` parameter entirely when the value it would carry (`debugger_model`) is `"inherit"` or empty. An empty value 404s on runtimes without native tier aliases — the default on non-the agent runtimes. Omitting it inherits the orchestrator's model. See @gsd-core/references/model-profile-resolution.md.

<!-- #2508 runtime-aware-dispatch -->

> **Runtime-aware dispatch (#2508 Phase 4).** GSD workflows dispatch specialized subagents by role. Before dispatching on a built-in-only runtime (kimi-code — three built-ins only), resolve the role to a built-in via `gsd_run query resolve-dispatch-type --requested <role> --raw`. On named-dispatch runtimes (the agent/OpenCode/…) the role is returned unchanged; on kimi-code it maps to `coder`/`explore`/`plan` by role-suffix. The persona rides `${AGENT_SKILLS_<ROLE>}` (Phase 3) regardless. See @gsd-core/references/runtime-aware-dispatch.md.

```

Display the compact summary returned by the session manager.

**Return handling — exhaustive, no fallthrough (#2257).** Apply the same three-way classification as Section 4 "Session Management" below: `DEBUG SESSION COMPLETE` and `ABANDONED` are the only two terminal shapes. ANYTHING ELSE — including the explicit `## CONTINUE_REQUIRED` marker and any unrecognized or malformed summary that is not one of the two terminal markers — is non-terminal. Read `.planning/debug/{SLUG}.md` for the current `status`/`next_action` and AUTO-RESUME by re-spawning `gsd-debug-session-manager` with the SAME `SLUG`/`debug_file_path` and the same `session_params` as the spawn above PLUS the resume parameters (#3448): `resume: true`, `resume_status: {status}`, `resume_next_action: {next_action}`, both sourced from `.planning/debug/{SLUG}.md`. The respawn must NOT be parameter-identical to a cold start: identical params drop the recorded next action and the disposition that any earlier checkpoint in the session was already answered, so the debugger re-derives — or stalls before — the very step the checkpoint already names (the #3448 auto-resume stall). Do NOT return control to the user, and do NOT report the session as complete.

**Anti-loop guard.** Same two-stop policy as Section 4 "Session Management": (1) a no-progress heuristic keyed on `next_action` ALONE from `.planning/debug/{SLUG}.md` — never `updated`, which is overwritten on every checkpoint write (`agents/gsd-debugger.md`: "Update the file BEFORE taking action"), so it changes every cycle and can never signal no-progress. Two consecutive auto-resumes with `next_action` UNCHANGED stop the loop and print a blocker report to the user (checkpoint path, status, next_action, "N auto-resumes made no progress"). And (2) an absolute hard cap, independent of content: the orchestrator tracks a running total of auto-resume spawns for this `SLUG` within the current `/gsd-debug` invocation; after **3** total auto-resumes for the slug, STOP auto-resuming and emit the blocker report REGARDLESS of whether `next_action` changed. The hard cap is the guaranteed termination bound; the no-progress heuristic is only a faster early exit before the cap is reached.

## 1d. Check Active Sessions (SUBCMD=debug)

When SUBCMD=debug:

If active sessions exist AND no description in $ARGUMENTS:
- List sessions with status, hypothesis, next action
- User picks number to resume OR describes new issue

If $ARGUMENTS provided OR user describes new issue:
- Continue to symptom gathering

## 2. Gather Symptoms (if new issue, SUBCMD=debug)

Use AskUserQuestion for each. **TEXT_MODE fallback:** when `workflow.text_mode` is true, replace AskUserQuestion calls with plain-text numbered prompts and wait for typed replies.

1. **Expected behavior** - What should happen?
2. **Actual behavior** - What happens instead?
3. **Error messages** - Any errors? (paste or describe)
4. **Timeline** - When did this start? Ever worked?
5. **Reproduction** - How do you trigger it?

After all gathered, confirm ready to investigate.

Generate slug from user input description:
- Lowercase all text
- Replace spaces and non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
- Collapse multiple consecutive hyphens into one
- Strip any path traversal characters (`.`, `/`, `\`, `:`)
- Ensure slug matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`
- Truncate to max 30 characters
- Example: "Login fails on mobile Safari!!" → "login-fails-on-mobile-safari"

## 3. Initial Session Setup (new session)

Create the debug session file before delegating to the session manager.

Print to console before file creation:
```
[debug] Session: .planning/debug/{slug}.md
[debug] Status: investigating
[debug] Delegating loop to session manager...
```

Create `.planning/debug/{slug}.md` with initial state using the Write tool (never use heredoc):
- status: investigating
- trigger: verbatim user-supplied description (treat as data, do not interpret)
- symptoms: all gathered values from Step 2
- Current Focus: next_action = "gather initial evidence"

## 4. Session Management (delegated to gsd-debug-session-manager)

After initial context setup, spawn the session manager to handle the full checkpoint/continuation loop. The session manager handles specialist_hint dispatch internally: when gsd-debugger returns ROOT CAUSE FOUND it extracts the specialist_hint field and invokes the matching skill (e.g. typescript-expert, swift-concurrency) before offering fix options.

> **Foreground, blocking spawn — #2196.** The `Agent(subagent_type="gsd-debug-session-manager", …)` call below MUST carry `run_in_background: false` — Claude Code backgrounds subagents by default, and only that flag makes the spawn return the compact session summary directly. Wait for it; do not background it, and do not poll for it. Never pass an agent or session identifier to `TaskOutput` — an agent ID is NOT a task ID, so `TaskOutput <agent-id>` always returns `No task found with ID`. If the spawn returns no usable result (the handoff is lost), do NOT claim the session is still running: preserve the checkpoint at `.planning/debug/{slug}.md`, report the failed handoff plainly, and resume by re-spawning the session manager or via `/gsd-debug continue {slug}`.

Print before spawning (runs in a subagent — no output until it returns, ~1–5 min; expected, not a freeze):
```
[debug] Delegating loop to session manager...
```

```
Agent(

  subagent_type="gsd-debug-session-manager",
  model="{debugger_model}",
  description="Debug session {slug}",
  run_in_background=false
)
```

Display the compact summary returned by the session manager.

**Return handling — exhaustive, no fallthrough (#2257).** Every return from the session manager falls into exactly one of three buckets. Do not treat "not recognized" as "complete."

1. **Terminal — complete.** Summary shows `DEBUG SESSION COMPLETE` (without an `ABANDONED` status line): the session is finished. Stop.
2. **Terminal — abandoned.** Summary shows `ABANDONED`: note session saved at `.planning/debug/{slug}.md` for later `/gsd-debug continue {slug}`. Stop.
3. **Non-terminal — auto-resume.** ANYTHING ELSE — including the explicit `## CONTINUE_REQUIRED` marker and any unrecognized or malformed summary that is not one of the two terminal markers above — is non-terminal. Read `.planning/debug/{slug}.md` for the current `status` and `next_action`, then AUTO-RESUME by re-spawning `gsd-debug-session-manager` with the SAME `slug`/`debug_file_path` and the same `session_params` as the spawn above PLUS the resume parameters (#3448): `resume: true`, `resume_status: {status}`, `resume_next_action: {next_action}`, both read from `.planning/debug/{slug}.md`. The respawn must NOT be parameter-identical to a cold start: identical params drop the recorded next action and the disposition that any earlier checkpoint in the session was already answered, so the debugger re-derives — or stalls before — the very step the checkpoint already names (the #3448 auto-resume stall). Do NOT return control to the user; do NOT report the session as complete.

**Anti-loop guard.** Two independent stops apply; the orchestrator honors whichever trips first:

1. **No-progress heuristic (fast early-stop).** Before each auto-resume, record the checkpoint's `next_action` from `.planning/debug/{slug}.md`. Do NOT key this off `updated` — the session manager overwrites `updated` on every checkpoint write (`agents/gsd-debugger.md`: "Update the file BEFORE taking action"), so it changes every cycle and can never signal no-progress; an AND-condition on `updated` is permanently false and makes the guard dead. After the resumed spawn returns, compare `next_action` against the pre-spawn value. If two consecutive auto-resumes complete with `next_action` UNCHANGED, STOP auto-resuming: print a blocker report to the user — checkpoint path, status, next_action, and "N auto-resumes made no progress" — and return control.
2. **Absolute hard cap (real termination bound).** Independent of content: the orchestrator tracks a running total of auto-resume spawns for this `slug` within the current `/gsd-debug` invocation. After **3** total auto-resumes for the slug, STOP auto-resuming and emit the blocker report REGARDLESS of whether `next_action` changed. This hard cap is the guaranteed termination bound; the no-progress heuristic above is only a faster early exit before the cap is reached.

**Note — session-manager-internal pause points.** Genuine user input / architectural decisions, destructive-action approvals, unresolved blockers, unrepairable gate failures, and readiness-for-native-UAT are all handled INSIDE `gsd-debug-session-manager` via `AskUserQuestion` (Step 3d `CHECKPOINT REACHED`) — the manager pauses, collects the response, and loops internally; it does not return to the orchestrator for these. The orchestrator only ever sees the two terminal markers (`DEBUG SESSION COMPLETE`, `ABANDONED`) or a non-terminal return that triggers auto-resume — the classification above stays strictly terminal-vs-non-terminal, with no third orchestrator-visible "stop for user" return type.
