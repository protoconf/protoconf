# Per-plan worktree decision (#2772)

Run this for **each plan in the current wave** before its `Agent()` dispatch. The output `USE_WORKTREES_FOR_PLAN` gates the dispatch branch (worktree mode vs sequential mode) for that plan only — other plans in the same wave can still take the worktree path.

`SUBMODULE_PATHS` is computed once in the `initialize` step (parsed from `.gitmodules`).

`PLAN_FILES` is the whitespace-separated list of paths the plan declared it will touch, extracted from the `phase-plan-index` JSON loaded in `discover_and_group_plans`:

```bash
# plan_json is the JSON object for this plan from PLAN_INDEX.plans[]
# files_modified is an array of strings (repo-relative paths or globs)
PLAN_FILES=$(jq -r '.files_modified // [] | join(" ")' <<<"$plan_json")
# #3003: files_deleted is the paths the plan declared it will REMOVE. Separate from
# files_modified on purpose — it authorizes the cleanup-wave deletions guard, and a
# deletion authorization must never be inferred from a general scope declaration.
PLAN_DELETIONS=$(jq -r '.files_deleted // [] | join(" ")' <<<"$plan_json")
plan_id=$(jq -r '.id' <<<"$plan_json")
```

Then run the per-plan gate:

```bash
USE_WORKTREES_FOR_PLAN="$USE_WORKTREES"

# #3003: this gate asks "does the plan touch a submodule at all", and REMOVING a file
# inside one is as much a touch as modifying it. Both declared channels feed the
# intersection: before files_deleted existed a deleted path had to appear in
# files_modified to be planned at all, so the gate saw it. Now that plan-md.md tells
# authors a deleted path needs no files_modified entry, reading files_modified alone
# would let a deletion-only submodule plan keep worktree isolation on — exactly the
# case #2772 disabled it for. Note this is the OPPOSITE posture from the cleanup-wave
# deletions guard: there the two channels are kept apart because a deletion
# AUTHORIZATION must never be inferred; here they are merged because a safety fallback
# must never MISS a touch.

After running this for the plan, the dispatch branches in `execute_waves` step 3 MUST gate on `USE_WORKTREES_FOR_PLAN` for the current plan, not on the project-level `USE_WORKTREES`. Track which plans in this wave actually used worktrees (append `plan_id` to a `WAVE_WORKTREE_PLANS` accumulator when `USE_WORKTREES_FOR_PLAN != false`) — the post-wave cleanup step (5.5) uses this to decide whether worktree-merge cleanup is needed at all.

**Re-record the dispatch-isolation sentinel, scoped to THIS plan (#3045 BLOCKER 1):**

The phase-level sentinel (written by the "Resolve ISOLATION" step, before any per-plan decision exists) authorizes/denies at the PHASE level. This per-plan gate can override that decision (submodule intersection forcing `USE_WORKTREES_FOR_PLAN=false` on an otherwise harness-worktree phase) — without a fresh, plan-scoped re-record, the isolation guard hooks would still be reading the STALE phase-level `harness-worktree` sentinel when this plan's dispatch omits the isolation kwarg (correctly, since it isn't worktree-isolated), producing a false DENY; or, symmetrically, a plan-level submodule degrade elsewhere in the wave could leave a stale `none` sentinel that a LATER, genuinely harness-worktree plan's own dispatch could be misread against. Run this immediately before dispatching THIS plan (right after computing `USE_WORKTREES_FOR_PLAN` above), so the sentinel is always fresh at the moment of dispatch and always keyed to the plan it authorizes:

**`PLAN_FILES` is reused after dispatch (#2596):** pass it as `--files "$PLAN_FILES"` on the step-3 `worktree.record-agent` call (and on `worktree.create` in the orchestrator-worktree path) so the post-wave cleanup gauntlet can compare each plan branch's actual committed diff against the scope the plan declared, and report any path outside it. That check is advisory — it warns, it never blocks the merge — and omitting the flag simply skips it for that plan.

**`PLAN_DELETIONS` is reused the same way (#3003):** pass it as `--deletions "$PLAN_DELETIONS"` on the same `worktree.record-agent` / `worktree.create` calls. Unlike `--files`, this one is **not** advisory — it is what lets the post-wave deletions guard merge a branch whose plan declared a file removal. Matching is exact per path: a declared path merges, anything else still blocks that entry (and only that entry). Omitting the flag keeps the guard's original behavior of blocking on any deletion at all, so a plan that declares nothing loses nothing.
