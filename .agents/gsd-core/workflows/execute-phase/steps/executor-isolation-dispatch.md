# Executor isolation dispatch (ADR-1239 / #2584 Phase 3)

Read and follow this fragment from `execute-phase.md` step 3 when dispatching a wave.
It owns the per-host dispatch detail so the host workflow stays inside its
ADR-857 Phase 6 byte budget (#1168) — the host step keeps only the `ISOLATION`
resolution and its fail-closed guard.

## Resolve ISOLATION

The resolution rule is shared with every other dispatch site — see
@gsd-core/references/dispatch-isolation-gate.md, the canonical statement of the
`ISOLATION`-not-`RUNTIME` contract (#2652). This fragment keeps the wave-specific
extras (`worktree.reap-orphans`, the `worktree.base-check` auto-degrade) inline below.

Run this in the config-gate step, right after `RUNTIME`/`USE_WORKTREES` are read.

```bash
_GSD_SHIM_NAME="gsd-tools.cjs"; _GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT="${RUNTIME_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}"; GSD_TOOLS="${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; _gsd_at() { for _p; do if [ -f "$_p" ]; then GSD_TOOLS="$_p"; return 0; fi; done; return 1; }; if _gsd_at "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.agents/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${_GSD_RUNTIME_ROOT}/.codex/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif unset -f gsd_run; _G="$(command -v gsd_run)"; then GSD_TOOLS="$_G"; gsd_run() { "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; elif _gsd_at "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cursor}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.copilot}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codeium/windsurf}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.augment}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${TRAE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.trae}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${QWEN_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.qwen}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.codebuddy}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${CLINE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.cline}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${GROK_AGENTS_HOME:-$HOME/.agents}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.gemini/antigravity}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/opencode}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}" "${KILO_CONFIG_DIR:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/kilo}/gsd-core/bin/${_GSD_SHIM_NAME}"; then gsd_run() { node "$GSD_TOOLS" "$@"; }; else echo "ERROR: gsd-tools.cjs not found at $GSD_TOOLS and gsd_run is not on PATH.

`ISOLATION` — not `RUNTIME` — selects how the wave fans out. These three values are the only
branch points; **never add a `RUNTIME = "codex"` test to the scheduler.** The per-host
invocation detail is descriptor data, surfaced by `dispatch-isolation --json` as
`harnessFlag` / `exec`.

| `ISOLATION` | Fan-out | What the scheduler does |
|---|---|---|
| `harness-worktree` | host-driven | Pass the host's own declared isolation flag (`harnessFlag`) on each executor dispatch and let the harness create + bind the worktree. GSD runs no git. |
| `orchestrator-worktree` | GSD-driven | GSD creates the worktree (`worktree create`), then process-spawns the executor bound to it via the resolved `exec` argv/cwd. GSD performs all git operations. |
| `none` | none | Plans run inline, sequentially (unchanged). |

Fail-closed is the invariant: an undeclared, unknown, or unresolvable isolation declaration
degrades to `none`, never to an unsafe parallel path. A `harness-worktree` host with no
declared flag, and an `orchestrator-worktree` host whose exec descriptor does not resolve,
both degrade to `none` rather than dispatching executors that only believe they are isolated.

## harness-worktree — pass the host flag

Read the flag once before dispatching; it is descriptor data, never hardcoded per runtime:

```bash
# #3045 CORE REDESIGN: `dispatch-isolation --json` already resolves and
# atomically records `harnessFlag` together with `isolation` and `phase` in
# ONE write, as a side effect of this same call (routeDispatchIsolation,
# gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs) — there is no separate "now also record the
# flag" step, and therefore no flagless window between recording the mode and
# recording the flag.
HARNESS_FLAG=$(gsd_run query dispatch-isolation --json --phase "${PHASE_NUMBER:-}" 2>/dev/null \
  | node -e 'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>{try{const j=JSON.parse(s);process.stdout.write(j&&j.harnessFlag?j.harnessFlag:"")}catch{process.stdout.write("")}})')
[ -n "$HARNESS_FLAG" ] || { echo "FATAL: runtime declares dispatch.isolation=harness-worktree but no harnessIsolationFlag — refusing to dispatch executors that would believe they are isolated." >&2; exit 1; }
```

Substitute `$HARNESS_FLAG`'s value for the `{harnessFlag}` placeholder in the `Agent()` dispatch
in `execute-phase.md` step 3 (on Claude Code it is literally `isolation="worktree"`).

## orchestrator-worktree — GSD creates the worktree and spawns the executor

The host has no harness-native isolation primitive, so **GSD** creates each worktree and process-spawns the executor into it. Fan-out is OS-level (N processes), not the host's subagent tool. Per the Codex `workspace-write` sandbox constraint, **the orchestrator performs every git operation** — create, merge, cleanup; the spawned executor only edits files and commits inside its own worktree.

Run the loop below once per runnable plan in the wave, **one plan at a time** (`git worktree add` races on `.git/config.lock`).

**Before running the bash block, substitute the plan's identifiers into it** exactly as you do for the `Agent()` prompt on the harness path: replace `{plan_number}` and `{phase_number}` with this plan's values. They are template placeholders, not shell variables. `$ORCH_ROOT` and `$EXPECTED_BASE` are real shell variables, already assigned earlier in this step; `$WAVE_WORKTREE_MANIFEST` was initialized above.

First build the executor prompt. It is the **same prompt text the harness path's `Agent()` call uses** — same executor identity, same execution context, same required-reading contract — with only the harness-only framing removed: drop the `<worktree_branch_check>` build-time embed note (this backend pins the base itself via `worktree create --base` and verifies it at merge) and the `<parallel_execution>` harness block (its SUMMARY-commit semantics ride inside the embedded `execute-plan.md` worktree mode). Keep `<objective>`, `<execution_context>`, `<required_reading>`, `${AGENT_SKILLS}`, and `<success_criteria>` from the harness prompt — substituting the worktree-specific `<execution_context>` framing below. The checkpoint gate rule (#3370, in `per-plan-executor-routing.md`) applies here too: add no prompt text refusing or overriding auto-approval for the default `gate="blocking"` — only `blocking-human` always surfaces.

#3637: the process-spawned child has NO host subagent machinery — nothing loads the `gsd-executor` agent definition or the execute-plan workflow unless THIS prompt carries them. A short objective-only prompt forces the child to reconstruct its role from the repository (skill discovery, inference) and leaves it unaware of the gitignored-planning skip semantics, which is how executors ended up force-staging gitignored `SUMMARY.md` files to satisfy an unconditional commit criterion. Build-time embeds below are therefore MANDATORY, and the resolution check after the assignment fails closed: if any embed source cannot be read, do NOT spawn a generic process and hope — halt the wave (the fail-closed check after `dispatch-isolation` handles the worktree teardown).

Assign the composed prompt to a shell variable so it can be passed as one argument:

```bash
# Compose the executor prompt for THIS plan. Single-quoted multi-line
# assignment (NOT a heredoc): these blocks are indented inside the workflow,
# and a heredoc terminator must sit at column 0 — `<<-` strips only tabs, not
# the leading spaces, so a heredoc here would never terminate. Single quotes
# also stop the shell expanding anything in the prompt body — the prompt MUST
# contain no single-quote character.
#
# ORCHESTRATOR BUILD-TIME EMBEDS (do these BEFORE the spawn, in order):
#   1. Inline each file listed in <execution_context> verbatim, in order.
#      An unreadable source file is a halt condition (#3637 fail-closed),
#      never a skip — a child without these texts is not a gsd-executor.
#   2. Substitute this plan's {plan_number}, {phase_number}, {phase_name},
#      {phase_dir}, and {plan_file} placeholders (same values the harness
#      path substitutes into its Agent() prompt).
#   3. Inline the gsd-executor ROLE DEFINITION: read `agents/gsd-executor.md`
#      (resolved against the install root the same way the harness runtime
#      resolves subagent types) and inline it verbatim at the provenance
#      marker below. The agent-skills query alone is NOT sufficient — its
#      block is the skills include list whenever the project configures
#      agent_skills for gsd-executor, and only an UNCONFIGURED non-the agent
#      project gets the full agent file via the #2454 fallback. The child has
#      no host subagent machinery, so the role definition must ride the prompt
#      (#3637 acceptance: resolved agent instructions as launch-level
#      instructions + provenance of which role definition was used).
# Resolve TDD-applicability for THIS plan (#4266/#4272) — fail closed on
# command failure, mirroring the ISOLATION resolution above: an absent
# verdict must never silently resolve to "not TDD" (ADR-3473 §8.4), since
# that would silently drop a real TDD plan's RED/GREEN/REFACTOR procedure.

- agents/gsd-executor.md (the ROLE DEFINITION you are executing — its steps
  0/0a/0b per-commit HEAD/cwd-drift/path-guard discipline applies to every
  commit you make in this worktree, and its final_commit contract is the

- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.planning/PROJECT.md (Project context — core value, requirements, evolution rules)
- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.planning/STATE.md (State)
- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.planning/config.json (Config, if exists)
- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/GEMINI.md (Project instructions, if exists — follow project-specific guidelines and coding conventions)
- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.agents/skills/ or ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.agents/skills/ (Project skills, if either exists — list skills, read SKILL.md for each, follow relevant rules during implementation)
- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/{phase_dir}/*-CONTEXT.md (User decisions from discuss-phase — honors locked choices; skip silently when none exist)
- ${PROJECT_ROOT}/{phase_dir}/*-RESEARCH.md (Technical research — pitfalls and patterns to follow; skip silently when none exist)

#    and halt rather than silently running the wave unisolated.

if [ "$EXEC_OK" != "true" ]; then

```

`--files` carries the plan's declared `files_modified` (the same `PLAN_FILES` the per-plan worktree gate extracts) so this backend routes through the SAME advisory scope-conformance check the the agent worktree path uses at merge (#2596) — one validation, both backends. It is advisory and never blocks; omitting it just skips the check.

`--deletions` carries the plan's declared `files_deleted` (`PLAN_DELETIONS`, extracted alongside `PLAN_FILES`) so this backend also routes through the deletions guard's opt-in (#3003). Unlike `--files` this one is **not** advisory: omitting it leaves the guard blocking on any deletion at all, which would make a plan that declares a removal merge on the harness path and fail here. Every dispatch surface that records a worktree must pass it.

`worktree create` records the entry in `$WAVE_WORKTREE_MANIFEST` itself, so **do not** call `worktree.record-agent` for these plans — that verb is the harness-path counterpart, used because the harness creates the worktree behind GSD's back. Double-recording is deduped by path+branch, but the create verb is the single writer here.

Spawn `EXEC_JSON`'s `command` + `args` as a background process with its working directory set to `EXEC_JSON.cwd`. The `cwd` is returned for **every** host, including those whose descriptor has no cwd flag (`cwdFlag: null`) and therefore bind through the process's own working directory — always set it, never assume the flag did the job. Wait for all spawned executors in the wave before merging.

The executor never touches `STATE.md`/`ROADMAP.md`, and that guard needs no new code — `execute-plan` auto-detects worktree mode via the `IS_WORKTREE` (`.git`-is-a-file) primitive, which a GSD-created worktree trips identically to a harness-created one.

Merge-back, validation, and cleanup are the **existing** gauntlet, unchanged: the serialized `worktree.cleanup-wave` merge loop that stops the wave and retains the worktree on conflict, and manifest-only cleanup (never glob-inferred). Because the manifest shape is identical, the orchestrator path reuses it verbatim.

> **Declared-scope conformance (#2596):** ADR-1239 specifies that *both* isolation adapters route their merge through a check that each plan branch's committed diff stayed inside its declared `files_modified` scope. That check now exists, advisory-first, and is wired into **both** paths: this one passes `--files "$PLAN_FILES"` to `worktree create` above, the harness path passes it to `worktree record-agent`, and `cleanup-wave` runs the one comparison for both. A path outside the declared scope is reported in the result's `warnings` array; it does not block the merge. Promotion to a hard gate is a separate, disclosed change.
