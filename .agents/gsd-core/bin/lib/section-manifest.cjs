/**
 * Section Manifest — pure `when=` evaluator over `InvocationFacts`, mapping
 * a document-order list of parsed `<!-- gsd-section -->` sections (Phase 3,
 * `src/workflow-fragments.cts`) to an included/excluded partition for one
 * concrete invocation (ADR-1671 epic #1671, Phase 5 / issue #2932,
 * `.gsd/phase/chore-2932-init-section-manifest/40-design.md`).
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, no dependency beyond node built-ins and the sibling
 * compiled module `workflow-fragments.cjs`, whose {@link
 * workflowFragments.WHEN_VOCABULARY} is imported and never redeclared here
 * (DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX — a second frozen copy of the same 4 strings would
 * silently desync from the source of truth the moment either side is edited
 * without the other).
 *
 * ## The evaluator is a LOOKUP, not a parser
 *
 * Derived from Greenspun's Tenth Rule (ADR-1671:69 cites it by name) and
 * binding on this implementation: `when=` is a closed vocabulary, widened
 * from 4 to 14 entries via the ADR-1671 amendment for #2992 (epic #1671
 * Phase 6.1; see `.gsd/phase/chore-2992-widen-when-vocabulary/
 * 40-design.md`), then from 14 to 19 via the ADR-1671 amendment for #2993
 * (epic #1671 Phase 6.2; see `.gsd/phase/chore-2993-fragmentize-plan-phase/
 * 40-design.md`), then from 19 to 20 via the ADR-1671 amendment for #2994
 * (epic #1671 Phase 6.3), then from 20 to 23 via a further #2994 amendment
 * fragmentizing `code-review.md` and `complete-milestone.md`, then from 23
 * to 24 via a still further #2994 amendment fragmentizing `autonomous.md`,
 * then from 24 to 26 via a still further #2994 amendment fragmentizing
 * `review.md` and `discuss-phase-assumptions.md`, then from 26 to 30 — and
 * finally to 29, `flag:--full` having been retired as dead vocabulary — via the
 * final #2994 slice fragmentizing `docs-update.md`, `update.md`,
 * `transition.md`, and `new-milestone.md`.
 * {@link WHEN_PREDICATES} is a total map from each frozen
 * vocabulary entry to exactly one predicate over {@link InvocationFacts}.
 * It MUST NOT tokenize, split on operators, or interpret structure in the
 * `when=` string — the moment it parses, the ad-hoc language has begun.
 * Every entry below is therefore a HAND-WRITTEN LITERAL: deriving a
 * predicate's flag/state name from its atom string (e.g. slicing `--fix`
 * out of `'flag:--fix'`) is tokenization relocated into this map and is
 * forbidden even though it would be shorter — the redundancy between each
 * key and its literal token is deliberate, and the bidirectional parity
 * test below catches any desync a hand-written entry could introduce. An
 * unrecognized `when=` value fails closed via {@link selectSections}
 * throwing a `TypeError` carrying `.reason = REASON.UNKNOWN_WHEN`; it is
 * never silently excluded (Postel's Law: liberal on FORMAT elsewhere in the
 * pipeline, strict on this SEMANTIC boundary — matching the discipline
 * Phase 3 already established for the same vocabulary at parse time).
 *
 * ## Totality over facts
 *
 * Every predicate treats an absent/missing fact key as falsy WITHOUT
 * throwing — {@link InvocationFacts} is a plain data object handed in by a
 * caller (the init CLI seam) that may not always populate every field, and
 * this module must never surprise that caller with an exception for an
 * omission rather than a malformed `when=` value.
 *
 * ## Partition invariant
 *
 * {@link selectSections} returns `included` and `excluded` id arrays that
 * together contain every input section's `id` exactly once, in the SAME
 * relative document order they appeared in the input — never mutating the
 * input array or its elements.
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: compiled by tsc to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/section-manifest.cjs (gitignored).
