/**
 * MCP served catalog — Phase B, issue #3072 (ADR-1671 epic #1671).
 * Design: `.gsd/phase/feat-3072-mcp-served-catalog/40-design.md`.
 *
 * Serves GSD's content tree as MCP **resources** (`gsd-core/workflows/*.md`,
 * `gsd-core/references/*.md`) and the 71 `commands/gsd/*.md` files as MCP
 * **prompts**, through the SAME composition rule the installer applies
 * (`bin/install.js`'s `copyWithPathReplacement`) — additive to the file-copy
 * floor, which stays untouched (ADR-1671 Decision 6).
 *
 * ## The two findings that shape this module's shape (40-design.md)
 *
 * **F1 — composition is scoped to `gsd-core/workflows/`, and that scoping is
 * load-bearing.** `bin/install.js` runs `composeWorkflow` (from
 * `workflow-fragments.cts`) only when the normalized source path matches
 * `(?:^|\/)gsd-core\/workflows\//`. A reference/command doc that merely
 * *documents* `<!-- gsd-section -->` marker syntax with an unfenced example
 * would otherwise be mis-parsed as a real marker and have that line lossily
 * dropped. {@link shouldCompose} is the ONE exported predicate both this
 * module and `bin/install.js` call — never a second, hand-duplicated regex
 * (ADR-1671:309, `DEFECT.GENERATIVE-FIX`).
 *
 * **F2 — parity cannot mean byte-equality with an emitted runtime tree.**
 * Install applies per-runtime path rewrites AFTER composition. The served
 * catalog is host-agnostic and rewrites for no runtime, so served bytes
 * equal the post-composition, pre-rewrite stage — the parity assertion is
 * that the catalog and the installer apply the SAME composition rule to the
 * SAME source, not that final bytes match an emitted tree.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * ```
 * buildCatalog({root?, readFile?, readDir?}) -> Catalog {resources, prompts}
 * readResource(catalog, uri)                 -> {uri, mimeType, text} | throws CatalogError
 * getPrompt(catalog, name, args?)             -> {description, messages}   | throws CatalogError
 * shouldCompose(relPath)                      -> boolean   // THE shared F1 predicate
 * listResources(catalog, {cursor?, pageSize?}) -> {resources, nextCursor?} | throws CatalogError
 * ```
 *
 * `listResources` is a delegation surface beyond the four primitives named in
 * the design's "Shape" block: `src/mcp-server.cts`'s `handleMessage` is
 * documented PURE and must stay thin (design "Shape" section), so cursor
 * pagination over the resource index is catalog-module responsibility, not
 * protocol-handler responsibility, mirroring how `shouldCompose` centralizes
 * the F1 predicate rather than letting it leak into the protocol layer.
 *
 * `buildCatalog`'s `root` is optional: omitted, the real implementation must
 * resolve the package root from THIS MODULE's own location (`__dirname`),
 * never from `ctx.cwd` (design row 16 / test-matrix rows 46-47) — `ctx.cwd`
 * is the user's *project* (state IO), the catalog lives in the *package*.
 *
 * Pure over injected `readFile`/`readDir` seams so tests inject IO faults by
 * monkeypatching the seam (never `chmod 0o000` — root bypasses mode bits and
 * the test would silently pass with zero coverage in CI).
 *
 * Every throw carries a stable {@link REASON} code via a typed `CatalogError`
 * (mirrors `workflow-fragments.cts`'s `REASON`/`fail()` idiom) so tests assert
 * `err.reason === REASON.X` rather than regex-/substring-matching the
 * human-readable message (CONTRIBUTING.md "Prohibited: Raw Text Matching on
 * Test Outputs").
 *
 * `src/mcp-server.cts` gains `resources/*` + `prompts/*` `handleMessage`
 * cases delegating to this module. The catalog is built once per process,
 * lazily, and is immutable for the process's lifetime (Gall's Law — no
 * watching, no invalidation, no subscriptions; see design "Known limits").
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: compiled by tsc to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/mcp-catalog.cjs (gitignored).
 *
 * ## Directory-walk fail-open/fail-closed split (buildCatalog)
 *
 * The three catalog roots (`gsd-core/workflows/`, `gsd-core/references/`,
 * `commands/gsd/`) are each reached through exactly ONE "speculative" probe —
 * `readDir(root/gsd-core)` and `readDir(root/commands)` — whose failure is
 * TOLERATED as "this segment has zero entries" (never fatal, never a crash;
 * design row 45 / row 16 "absent root does not fall back to cwd"). Every
 * directory reached AFTER that, because a parent's successful listing already
 * reported it as a real subdirectory entry, is CONFIRMED to exist; a read
 * failure for a confirmed directory is fatal (`REASON.READ_FAILED`, design
 * row 43 "a directory read failure fails closed" — "no partial catalog
 * silently served"). This is what lets an absent `commands/` tree (row 45 /
 * many unit fixtures that only populate `gsd-core/workflows/`) build an empty
 * segment silently, while an INJECTED failure on an already-listed
 * `gsd-core/workflows/` directory (row 43) still fails the whole build.
 *
 * `readFile` is never called at build time — only `readDir`, for discovery.
 * A single resource's content is read (and, for a workflow, composed) lazily
 * inside {@link readResource}/{@link getPrompt}, so a bad `readFile` for ONE
 * entry never prevents that entry from being *listed*, only from being
 * *read* (design row 14 / test-matrix row 42).
