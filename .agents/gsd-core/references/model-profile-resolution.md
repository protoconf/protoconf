# Model Profile Resolution

Resolve each agent's model through `gsd-tools`, then pass it to the `Agent()` spawn — or
omit the parameter entirely when nothing resolved.

## Resolution Pattern

Prefer the field your workflow's own `init.*` payload already emits (every orchestrator
init that spawns subagents carries one — `mapper_model`, `planner_model`,
`executor_model`, `doc_writer_model`, …). Declare it in the workflow's parse line so the
binding is stated, not implied:

```
Parse JSON for: `mapper_model`, …
```

When the agent type is only known at runtime — a capability hook naming its own agent, for
example — resolve it directly instead:

```bash
AGENT_MODEL=$(gsd_run query resolve-model "<agent-type>" --raw)
```

Both surfaces return the same thing: a model string for the active runtime, or the **empty
string** when nothing resolved.

## Lookup Table

@.agents/gsd-core/references/model-profiles.md

## Passing the model to a spawn

```
Agent(
  prompt="...",
  subagent_type="gsd-planner",
  model="{planner_model}"
)
```

Substitute the field **this workflow bound** — never a generic placeholder name.

**#2517 — omit, do not emit an empty model.** When the resolved value is `"inherit"` or
empty, **omit the `model=` parameter entirely**:

```
Agent(
  prompt="...",
  subagent_type="gsd-planner"
)
```

No model parameter is passed at all — `planner_model` resolved to `"inherit"` or empty, and
omitting it inherits the orchestrator's model. Passing either value through as an argument
instead 404s on non-the agent runtimes.

This is not cosmetic, and both values really occur. `model_profile: "inherit"` — and any
opus-tier agent — resolves to the literal string `"inherit"`. `resolve_model_ids: "omit"`
resolves to the **empty string** whenever the project sets it explicitly or the active
runtime has no native tier aliases; an agent type absent from the profile table takes that
same empty-string path, because it has no tier for the earlier steps to resolve. Emitting
either value verbatim fails the spawn on every runtime without native tier aliases.

**#2684 — substitute a field your workflow actually bound.** `model="{…}"` must name a key
your own `init.*` payload emits, a shell variable you assigned, or a field on your declared
parse line. A placeholder that resolves to nothing does not fail loudly — the orchestrator
silently invents a value, which is the invisible partial application ADR-1411 prohibits.
`tests/model-omit-when-inherit-guard.test.cjs` enforces both rules.

## Profile semantics

**Note:** Opus-tier agents resolve to `"inherit"` (not `"opus"`). This causes the agent to
use the parent session's model, avoiding conflicts with organization policies that may
block specific opus versions — and, per the rule above, means the `model=` parameter is
omitted rather than set.

If `model_profile` is `"adaptive"`, agents resolve to role-based assignments (opus/sonnet/
haiku based on agent type).

If `model_profile` is `"inherit"`, all agents resolve to `"inherit"` (useful for OpenCode
`/model`).

## Usage

1. Bind the model once — from the `init.*` payload field, or `query resolve-model` when the
   agent type is runtime-determined
2. Declare the bound field on the workflow's parse line
3. Pass `model="{bound_field}"` on each `Agent()` spawn
4. Omit `model=` entirely whenever the bound value is `"inherit"` or empty
