**Exception:** If `gaps_found`, the `verify_phase_goal` step already presents the gap-closure path (`/gsd-plan-phase {X} --gaps`). No additional routing needed — skip auto-advance.

**No-transition check (spawned by auto-advance chain):**

Parse `--no-transition` flag from $ARGUMENTS.

**If `--no-transition` flag present:**

Execute-phase was spawned by plan-phase's auto-advance. Do NOT run transition.md.
After verification passes and roadmap is updated, return completion status to parent:

```
## PHASE COMPLETE

Phase: ${PHASE_NUMBER} - ${PHASE_NAME}
Plans: ${completed_count}/${total_count}
Verification: {Passed | Gaps Found}

[Include aggregate_results output]
```

STOP. Do not proceed to auto-advance or transition.

**If `--no-transition` flag is NOT present:**

**Auto-advance detection:**

1. Parse `--auto` flag from $ARGUMENTS
2. Read consolidated auto-mode (`active` = chain flag OR user preference; chain flag already synced in init step):
   ```bash
   AUTO_MODE=$(gsd_run query check auto-mode --pick active 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   ```

**If `--auto` flag present OR `AUTO_MODE` is true (AND verification passed with no gaps):**

```
### AUTO-ADVANCING → TRANSITION

Phase {X} verified, continuing chain
```

Execute the transition workflow inline (do NOT use Agent — orchestrator context is ~10-15%, transition needs phase completion data already in context):

Read and follow `.agents/gsd-core/workflows/transition.md`, passing through the `--auto` flag so it propagates to the next phase invocation.

**If neither `--auto` nor `AUTO_MODE` is true:**

**STOP. Do not auto-advance. Do not execute transition. Do not plan next phase. Present options to the user and wait.**

**IMPORTANT: There is NO `/gsd-transition` command. Never suggest it. The transition workflow is internal only.**

Check whether CONTEXT.md already exists for the next phase:

```bash
ls .planning/phases/*{next}*/{next}-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || echo "no-context"
```

If CONTEXT.md does **not** exist for the next phase, present:

```
## ✓ Phase {X}: {Name} Complete

/gsd-progress ${GSD_WS} — see updated roadmap
/gsd-discuss-phase {next} ${GSD_WS} — start here: discuss next phase before planning  ← recommended
/gsd-plan-phase {next} ${GSD_WS} — plan next phase (skip discuss)
/gsd-execute-phase {next} ${GSD_WS} — execute next phase (skip discuss and plan)
```

If CONTEXT.md **exists** for the next phase, present:

```
## ✓ Phase {X}: {Name} Complete

/gsd-progress ${GSD_WS} — see updated roadmap
/gsd-plan-phase {next} ${GSD_WS} — start here: plan next phase (CONTEXT.md already present)  ← recommended
/gsd-discuss-phase {next} ${GSD_WS} — re-discuss next phase
/gsd-execute-phase {next} ${GSD_WS} — execute next phase (skip planning)
```

Only suggest the commands listed above. Do not invent or hallucinate command names.
