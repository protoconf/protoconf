<objective>
Audit Nyquist validation coverage for a completed phase. Three states:
- (A) VALIDATION.md exists — audit and fill gaps
- (B) No VALIDATION.md, SUMMARY.md exists — reconstruct from artifacts
- (C) Phase not executed — exit with guidance

Output: updated VALIDATION.md + generated test files.
</objective>
