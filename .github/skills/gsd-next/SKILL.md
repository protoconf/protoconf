<objective>
GSD smart entry — the state-aware front door. Detect what's going on in this project, then present a short menu of the right next actions and dispatch to one.

This is a launcher/router only. It never does the work itself. It reads project + workflow state via `gsd-tools smart-entry --json`, shows a situation-appropriate menu, and hands off to an existing GSD command.
