<objective>
Start a new milestone: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

Brownfield equivalent of new-project. Project exists, PROJECT.md has history. Gathers "what's next", updates PROJECT.md, then runs requirements → roadmap cycle.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — updated with new milestone goals
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional, NEW features only)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements for this milestone
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure (continues numbering)
- `.planning/STATE.md` — reset for new milestone

**After:** `/gsd-plan-phase [N]` to start execution.
