<objective>
Invoke external AI CLIs (Gemini, the agent, Codex, OpenCode, Qwen Code, Cursor) to independently review phase plans.
Produces a structured REVIEWS.md with per-reviewer feedback that can be fed back into
planning via /gsd-plan-phase --reviews.

**Flow:** Detect CLIs → Build review prompt → Invoke each CLI → Collect responses → Write REVIEWS.md
</objective>

<context>
Phase number: extracted from $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Flags:**
- `--gemini` — Include Gemini CLI review
- `--claude` — Include the agent CLI review (uses separate session)
- `--codex` — Include Codex CLI review
- `--opencode` — Include OpenCode review (uses model from user's OpenCode config)
- `--qwen` — Include Qwen Code review (Alibaba Qwen models)
- `--cursor` — Include Cursor agent review
- `--agy` / `--antigravity` — Include Antigravity CLI review
- `--all` — Include all available CLIs

**No flags** — if `review.default_reviewers` is set, review with only those configured
reviewers that are detected; otherwise review with all available CLIs. Configured
`review.reviewer_instances` names may appear in `review.default_reviewers`; each runs as an
independent reviewer identity backed by its configured adapter+model (see
`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`). Instance names are not valid as flags.
