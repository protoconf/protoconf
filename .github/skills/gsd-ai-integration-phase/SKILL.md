<objective>
Create an AI design contract (AI-SPEC.md) for a phase involving AI system development.
Orchestrates gsd-framework-selector → gsd-ai-researcher → gsd-domain-researcher → gsd-eval-planner.
Flow: Select Framework → Research Docs → Research Domain → Design Eval Strategy → Done
</objective>

</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS — optional; when omitted, the orchestrating workflow reads ROADMAP.md and selects the next unplanned phase. This is not a `gsd-tools.cjs` CLI feature — the CLI's phase-lookup primitives require an explicit phase number.
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates.
