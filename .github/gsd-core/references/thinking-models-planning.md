# Thinking Models: Planning Cluster

Structured reasoning models for the **planner** and **roadmapper** agents. Apply these at decision points during plan creation, not continuously. Each model counters a specific documented failure mode.

Source: Curated from [thinking-partner](https://github.com/mattnowdev/thinking-partner) model catalog (150+ models). Selected for direct applicability to GSD planning workflow.

## Conflict Resolution

Pre-Mortem and Constraint Analysis both analyze risk at different granularities. Run Constraint Analysis FIRST (identify the hardest constraint), then Pre-Mortem (enumerate failure modes around that constraint and the rest of the plan).

## 1. Pre-Mortem Analysis

**Counters:** Optimistic plan decomposition that ignores failure modes.

Before finalizing this plan, assume it has already failed. List the 3 most likely reasons for failure -- missing dependency, wrong decomposition, underestimated complexity -- and add mitigation steps or acceptance criteria that would catch each failure early.

## 2. MECE Decomposition

**Counters:** Overlapping tasks (merge conflicts) or gapped tasks (missing requirements).

Verify this task breakdown is MECE at the REQUIREMENT level: (1) list every requirement from the phase goal, (2) confirm each maps to exactly one task's `<done>`, (3) if two tasks modify the same file, confirm they modify DIFFERENT sections or serve DIFFERENT requirements, (4) flag any requirement not covered by any task.

## 3. Constraint Analysis

**Counters:** Deferring the hardest constraint to the last task, causing late-stage failures.

Identify the single hardest constraint in this phase -- the one thing that, if it doesn't work, makes everything else irrelevant. Schedule that constraint as Task 1 or 2, not last. If the constraint involves an external API or unfamiliar library, add a spike/proof-of-concept task before the main implementation.

## 4. Reversibility Test

**Counters:** Over-analyzing cheap decisions, under-analyzing costly ones.

For each significant decision in this plan, ask what undoing it would cost three phases from now, and rate it `reversible` (local and cheap to change), `costly` (undo touches many call sites or needs a coordinated change), or `one-way` (undo requires a migration, breaks a published contract, or is impossible). Spend analysis time proportional to the rating. Record the rating and a one-line rationale on the task that implements the decision, via `<reversibility>`; a `one-way` rating also earns a `checkpoint:decision` before that task. When unsure, rate it `reversible` — rating everything `one-way` is checkpoint fatigue, not diligence.

This is the reasoning step that produces the rating. The taxonomy itself, the emission rules, and the anti-patterns live in @.github/gsd-core/references/planner-reversibility.md — do not maintain a second classification here.

## 5. Curse of Knowledge Counter

**Counters:** Plan-to-executor ambiguity from compressed instructions.

For each `<action>` step, re-read it as if you have NEVER seen this codebase. Is every noun unambiguous (which file? which function? which endpoint?)? Is every verb specific (add WHERE? modify HOW?)? If a step could be interpreted two ways, rewrite it. Include file paths, function names, and expected behavior in every action step.

## 6. Base Rate Neglect Counter

**Counters:** Planners ignoring low-confidence research caveats.

Before finalizing the plan, read ALL `[NEEDS DECISION]` items and LOW-confidence recommendations from SUMMARY.md. For each: either (a) create a `checkpoint:decision` task to resolve it, or (b) document why the risk is acceptable in the plan's deviation notes. LOW-confidence items that are silently accepted become undocumented technical debt.

## Gap Closure Mode: Root-Cause Check

**Applies only when:** Planner enters gap closure mode (triggered by `gaps_found` in VERIFICATION.md).

Before writing the fix plan, apply a single "why" round: Why did this gap occur? Was it a plan deficiency (wrong task), an execution miss (correct task, wrong implementation), or a changed assumption (environment/dependency shift)? The fix plan must target the root cause category, not just the symptom.

## When NOT to Think

Skip structured reasoning models when the situation does not benefit from them:

- **Single-task plans** -- If the phase has one clear requirement and one obvious task, do not run Pre-Mortem or MECE analysis. Write the task directly.
- **Well-researched phases** -- If RESEARCH.md has HIGH-confidence recommendations for every decision and no `[NEEDS DECISION]` items, skip Base Rate Neglect Counter. The research already resolved uncertainty.
- **Revision iterations** -- When revising a plan based on checker feedback, focus on fixing the flagged issues. Do not re-run the full model suite on every revision pass -- apply only the model relevant to the specific issue (e.g., MECE if the checker found a coverage gap).
- **Boilerplate plans** -- Configuration changes, version bumps, documentation updates. These do not have failure modes worth pre-mortem analysis.
