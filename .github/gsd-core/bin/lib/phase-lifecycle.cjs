 *   - clampPercent(completed, total): percent with 100 ceiling
 *
 * These two functions are the root-cause fix for issue #4.

 *
 * ADR-2143 §3 ("addressed by NAME, never ordinal"): the Progress table is
 * located via the markdown-table seam's `findTableWithColumns`, which is
 * column-NAME/order/count-invariant — it matches the first table whose header
 * is a SUPERSET of the canonical `Phase` / `Plans Complete` / `Status` /
 * `Completed` names, in any order, tolerating extra/injected unrelated
 * columns (#2137's fast-check property test shuffles headers and injects
 * columns and asserts the derived counts never change). This supersedes the
 * earlier `findTableBySchema` exact-schema lookup, which required an exact
 * canonical column SET+ORDER and returned all-null on any reordering or
 * injection.
 *
 * Scoped to the `## Progress` section when the document has one (#2012 decoy
 * avoidance — a differently-headed table sharing the same column names must
 * not be picked up instead); a headingless milestone slice (#1445) falls back
 * to scanning the whole input, preserving the "Progress table not under a
 * `## Progress` heading, or not the first table in the document, still
 * resolves" behaviour.
