/**
 * Workflow Fragments — in-file `<!-- gsd-section -->` marker parser/composer
 * for GSD workflow markdown files (ADR-1671 epic #1671, Phase 3 / issue #2930,
 * `.gsd/phase/chore-2930-fragmentize-xl-workflow/40-design.md`).
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, no dependency beyond node built-ins and the shared
 * budget-trim seam `context-composer.cjs` (issue #2929). Emission order is
 * `parseWorkflowSections` -> `toFragments` -> `composeWithinBudget` ->
 * `renderFragments` (= `composeWorkflow`), run BEFORE the per-runtime
 * converters so a marker attribute never reaches a path-rewrite regex.
 *
 * ## Marker grammar (CLOSED)
 *
 * Open:  a line whose only content (after trimming leading/trailing
 *        whitespace) is `<!-- gsd-section id="<id>" when="<when>" -->`.
 * Close: a line whose only content is `<!-- /gsd-section -->`.
 *
 * Attribute order is free and inner spacing is flexible (Postel on FORMAT);
 * `id` and `when` VALUES are validated strictly and fail closed (Postel is
 * deliberately NOT applied to semantics — an unrecognized `when` is an
 * authoring instruction that must never be silently dropped). `id` matches
 * `/^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/`; `when` must be `===` exactly one
 * entry of the frozen {@link WHEN_VOCABULARY} — no operators, no negation,
 * no nesting (Greenspun's Tenth Rule: extending the vocabulary is a
 * coordinated ADR amendment, never an organic edit).
 *
 * ## Partition invariant
 *
 * `parseWorkflowSections` returns sections that PARTITION the document:
 * every byte that is not part of a marker LINE belongs to exactly one
 * section, in document order. Text outside any marker pair becomes a
 * synthesized gap section (`explicit: false`, id `gap-<n>`, n from 0). A
 * marker line is removed IN FULL — text and its original line terminator —
 * so an unmarked document (88 of 89 workflows today) parses to exactly one
 * implicit gap fragment and composes back byte-identical.
 *
 * Line splitting is CRLF-aware per line (not `content.split('\n')`, which
 * would leave a stray `\r` glued to `.text` and cannot express a mixed
 * CRLF-marker/LF-body document): {@link splitLinesPreservingEol} records
 * each line's own terminator (`''`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`) so reassembly is
 * exact regardless of line-ending mixture.
 *
 * ## Fence + comment interleaving (the highest-risk code here)
 *
 * A marker is structural only when it is NOT inside a fenced code block and
 * NOT inside an unrelated HTML comment (`<!-- gsd-loop-host ... -->` is a
 * different marker family entirely and is left untouched by construction —
 * it does not match the `gsd-section` token). Fences and comments are
 * scanned in ONE left-to-right interleaved pass with two mutually exclusive
 * states (`fence`, `inComment`), copying the discipline documented in
 * `src/context-predicates.cts`'s module comment (DEFECT.CONTEXT-PREDICATES-
 * COMMENT-FENCE-BLIND, #2928): while a fence is open, only a matching closer
 * can end it (a `<!--`/`-->` token on a fenced line is fence content, never
 * a comment boundary); while a comment is open, only a `-->` token can end
 * it (a fence delimiter inside it is comment content, never a fence
 * boundary); when neither is open, a comment opener is checked BEFORE a
 * fence opener (HTML comments are lexically outermost). A two-pass design
 * (mask one construct, then scan for the other) resolves this wrongly in
 * one direction and silently skips to EOF — that is the exact defect this
 * module avoids by construction. An unclosed fence at EOF does NOT throw;
 * everything after it is simply literal.
 *
 * One deliberate refinement beyond a naive "does the trimmed line START
 * WITH `<!--` and END WITH `-->`" check: whether a comment PERSISTS past
 * the current line is decided by `.includes('-->')` (does a close token
 * appear anywhere on the line), not by `.endsWith('-->')`. A line like
 * `<!-- TODO: fix --> some trailing prose` closes its comment on the same
 * line and must not swallow the rest of the document — it is simply not a
 * `gsd-section` marker (a marker's grammar requires the comment to be the
 * line's ONLY content), and is left as ordinary content in whichever
 * section/gap contains it.
 *
 * Known inherited limitation (shared with `context-predicates.cts`, not a
 * regression introduced here): comment-open detection is anchored to the
 * start of the trimmed line. An HTML comment that opens *mid-line* (prose
 * followed by an unclosed `<!--`) is not tracked, so a `gsd-section`-shaped
 * line appearing on a later line inside that comment would be misread as
 * real. GSD workflow markers are always authored on their own line, so this
 * does not affect the production shape; documented here rather than papered
 * over.
 *
 * ADR-457 build-at-publish: compiled by tsc to
 * gsd-core/bin/lib/workflow-fragments.cjs (gitignored).

 * (epic #1671 Phase 6.2; see `.gsd/phase/chore-2993-fragmentize-plan-phase/
 * 40-design.md`), then from 19 to 20 via the ADR-1671 amendment for #2994
 * (epic #1671 Phase 6.3, `verify-work.md`), then from 20 to 23 via a further
 * #2994 amendment fragmentizing `code-review.md` and `complete-milestone.md`,
 * then from 23 to 24 via a further #2994 amendment fragmentizing
 * `autonomous.md`, then from 24 to 26 via a still further #2994 amendment
 * fragmentizing `review.md` and `discuss-phase-assumptions.md`, then from 26
 * to 30 (then 29; `flag:--full` retired as dead vocabulary) via the FINAL
 * #2994 slice (epic #1671 Phase 6.3) fragmentizing
 * `docs-update.md`, `update.md`, `transition.md`, and `new-milestone.md` —
 * every one of the 13 workflows targeted by ADR-1671 is now on the fragment
 * model. The vocabulary remains CLOSED: no operators, no negation, no nesting.
 * Cardinality is not expressiveness — a 29-entry flat list with no
 * composition is still not a language.
 *
 * Held at 14, not wider: an atom whose fact is never computed always
 * evaluates FALSE, so a section marked with it would silently never
 * include — a silent-exclusion bug, not a feature. One further atom
 * (`flag:--verify-only`) was surveyed but is NOT admitted even now that
 * `docs-update` has its own `cmdInit*` entry point (`cmdInitDocsUpdate`):
 * the flag's control flow is INTERLEAVED across three non-contiguous
 * touch-points in `docs-update.md` (an inline early-exit check in
 * `init_context` — "If `--verify-only` is present…skip to
 * verify_only_report" — a "Skip condition" note embedded in another step's
 * body, and the `verify_only_report` step itself) rather than a single
 * contiguous, whole-line, purely-additive region — admitting the atom to
 * gate only the `verify_only_report` step would leave the other two
 * touch-points as un-migrated raw `$ARGUMENTS` checks. `state:is-monorepo`
 * (`dispatch-monorepo-packages` section) IS admitted in this slice — see the
 * paragraph below.
 * `flag:--fix`, `state:fallow-enabled`, and `state:git-create-tag` were
 * withheld for the same reason until a further #2994 amendment gave
 * `code-review` and `complete-milestone` their own dedicated `cmdInit*`
 * entry points (`cmdInitCodeReview`, `cmdInitCompleteMilestone`). The
 * originally-surveyed `flag:--converge` never shipped under that name: once
 * `autonomous` gained its own dedicated `cmdInitAutonomous` entry point, the
 * admitted atom is `state:plan-strategy-converge` instead — `--cross-ai` is
 * a documented alias for `--converge` (`autonomous.md`'s own `PLAN_STRATEGY`
 * resolver folds both into one value), so a `flag:--converge`-only atom
 * would have left `--cross-ai`-only invocations silently excluded from the
 * same sections; see the `state:plan-strategy-converge` paragraph below.
 * `state:reviewer-instances-configured` and `state:auto-advance-active` were
 * withheld the same way until `review` and `discuss-phase-assumptions`
 * gained their own dedicated `cmdInit*` entry points (`cmdInitReview`,
 * `cmdInitDiscussPhaseAssumptions`).
 *
 * The #2993 widening adds 5 entries fragmentizing `plan-phase.md`:
 * `flag:--ingest`, `flag:--prd`, `flag:--research-phase`, `flag:--reviews`,
 * `state:chunked-mode`. `state:chunked-mode` is a disjunction (`--chunked`
 * flag OR `.planning/config.json` `workflow.plan_chunked`) resolved to a
 * single boolean FACT by the init seam (`src/init.cts`) — the grammar still
 * sees exactly one atom with no operator, preserving the same guard.
 *
 * The #2994 widening adds 1 entry fragmentizing `verify-work.md`:
 * `state:ui-phase-active`. Like `state:chunked-mode`, it is a disjunction —
 * the phase's active `plan:pre` loop hooks include the `ui-phase` step OR
 * the phase directory already contains a `*-UI-SPEC.md` — resolved to a
 * single boolean FACT by the init seam before it ever reaches this grammar.
 *
 * A further #2994 widening (epic #1671 Phase 6.3) adds 3 entries
 * fragmentizing `code-review.md` and `complete-milestone.md`: `flag:--fix`
 * (`dispatch-fix` section), `state:fallow-enabled` (`structural-pre-pass`
 * section — the fallow config-gate resolver, previously re-derived inside
 * the section body itself, is hoisted into `cmdInitCodeReview` and exposed
 * as top-level `fallow_*` init-bundle fields), and `state:git-create-tag`
 * (`git-tag` section — the `git.create_tag` config-gate resolver is hoisted
 * into `cmdInitCompleteMilestone`).
 *
 * A still further #2994 widening (epic #1671 Phase 6.3) adds 1 entry
 * fragmentizing `autonomous.md`: `state:plan-strategy-converge`, gating five
 * sections (`converge-fail-fast`, `converge-banner`, `converge-dispatch-bg`,
 * `converge-dispatch-inline`, `converge-loop`) that all share the same atom
 * — legal and precedented (`plan-phase.md`'s `research-only-*` pair already
 * shares `flag:--research-phase`). It is a disjunction — `--converge` OR its
 * documented alias `--cross-ai` — resolved to a single boolean FACT by the
 * new `cmdInitAutonomous` entry point (`flags.has('--converge') ||
 * flags.has('--cross-ai')`) before it ever reaches this grammar, same
 * discipline as `state:chunked-mode`/`state:ui-phase-active` above.
 *
 * A still further #2994 widening (epic #1671 Phase 6.3) adds 2 entries
 * fragmentizing `review.md` and `discuss-phase-assumptions.md`:
 * `state:reviewer-instances-configured` (`reviewer-instances-note-1` and
 * `reviewer-instances-note-2` sections — two peripheral notes sharing one
 * atom, the same sharing pattern `plan-phase.md`'s `research-only-*` pair
 * already established) and `state:auto-advance-active` (`auto-advance-dispatch`
 * section — a disjunction, `--auto` flag OR a consolidated auto-mode config
 * fact, resolved to a single boolean FACT by the new
 * `cmdInitDiscussPhaseAssumptions` entry point before it ever reaches this
 * grammar, same discipline as `state:chunked-mode` above).
 *
 * The FINAL #2994 widening (epic #1671 Phase 6.3) adds 4 entries, closing
 * out the last four workflows on ADR-1671's fragmentization list —
 * `docs-update.md`, `update.md`, `transition.md`, `new-milestone.md` — none
 * of which carried a `gsd_run query init.*` call before this slice:
 * `state:is-monorepo` (`dispatch-monorepo-packages` section, new
 * `cmdInitDocsUpdate` entry point — reuses `docs.cts`'s own
 * `detectMonorepoWorkspaces` detector rather than a second scan);
 * `state:next-channel` (`channel-banner` section, new `cmdInitUpdate` entry
 * point — `--next` OR its documented alias `--rc`, resolved in PARALLEL
 * with, not in place of, `update.md`'s own `TAG="next"` case-statement,
 * which issue #815's regression test requires to stay literal in the
 * workflow); `state:workstream-active` (`workstream-collision-check`
 * section, new `cmdInitTransition` entry point — a workstream is active,
 * `GSD_WORKSTREAM` env falling back to the stored active-workstream
 * pointer, the same authoritative source `cmdInitProgress` already uses);
 * and `state:flat-mode` (`project-md-milestone-write` section,
 * `cmdInitNewMilestone` — the positively-phrased INVERSE of
 * `state:workstream-active`, introduced because the grammar has no negation
 * operator and `new-milestone.md`'s Step 4 Part A is gated on the OPPOSITE
 * condition from `transition.md`'s section).
