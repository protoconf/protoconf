/**
 * Install Fs Adapter — #2874 (epic #2866 Phase 5), governed by ADR-58.
 *
 * Narrow, enumerated fs seam for the install/staging call tree rooted at
 * `installRuntimeArtifacts` (install-engine.cts): layout source-root
 * resolution (runtime-artifact-layout.cts), profile staging
 * (install-profiles.cts), content-rewrite passes
 * (runtime-artifact-conversion.cts), the CommonJS module-type marker
 * (commonjs-marker.cts), and the two installer-migrations entry points this
 * call tree reaches — `readInstallManifest` / `classifyArtifact`
 * (installer-migrations.cts). Extends the `deps` bag precedent already
 * established by `createRuntimeArtifactInstallPlan`
 * (runtime-artifact-install-plan.cts:155) — this is NOT a general-purpose
 * `node:fs` wrapper (40-design.md "Rejected" #1): only the operations this
 * call tree actually performs are enumerated below. installer-migrations.cts
 * is ~1200 lines covering migration planning/apply/rollback/locking/journal
 * machinery unrelated to `installRuntimeArtifacts` — only its two reachable
 * entry points (and `sha256File`, their shared hashing helper — still raw-fd
 * streaming via `openSync`/`readSync`/`closeSync`, now routed through this
 * seam instead of calling `node:fs` directly, so large-file hashing never
 * buffers a whole file through the injected adapter either) are routed; the
 * rest of that file is untouched, deliberately, because it is off this call
 * tree.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DELIVERY MECHANISM — ambient, not threaded (read this before adding a call
 * site that needs a different adapter mid-call)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A single mutable "current adapter" (`current`, below) is swapped for the
 * duration of one synchronous `installRuntimeArtifacts` call via
 * `withInstallFs`, rather than a `deps` parameter threaded through every
 * function on the call tree. The rejected alternative was threading: it
 * would touch signatures across `install-profiles.cts` (5 staging
 * functions), the 3000+-line `runtime-artifact-conversion.cts` (rewrite
 * passes), `commonjs-marker.cts`, and `installer-migrations.cts` — a dozen+
 * unrelated call sites — for no behavioral gain over an ambient swap, and
 * `createRuntimeArtifactInstallPlan`'s own `deps` bag (the precedent this
 * seam extends) does not reach that deep either. Every fs-touching site on
 * the call tree reads the active adapter via `installFs()` instead of
 * importing `node:fs` directly.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS-ONLY / RE-ENTRANCY ASSUMPTION (load-bearing, not incidental):
 * every method on this seam is `*Sync`, and `installRuntimeArtifacts` never
 * awaits mid-call — the whole call tree from the top-level `withInstallFs`
 * wrap down to the last `fs` touch runs on one turn of the event loop with
 * no interleaving. That is what makes a single ambient variable safe instead
 * of a race: nothing else can observe or mutate `current` while it is set.
 * This assumption BREAKS if `installRuntimeArtifacts` (or anything it calls)
 * ever becomes `async`, or if two installs run concurrently in the same
 * process (the second `withInstallFs` call would clobber the first's
 * adapter mid-flight) — neither is true today, but a future change that
 * introduces either must revisit this module before trusting it.
 *
 * DEFERRED CLEANUP ACROSS THE RESTORE (#2874 leak-fix): staged directories
 * outlive one `withInstallFs` call — `install-profiles.cts`'s
 * `cleanupStagedSkills` runs later, from a `process.on('exit'/'SIGINT'/…)`
 * handler, by which time `withInstallFs`'s `finally` has already restored
 * `current` back to whatever was active before (real fs, in the top-level
 * case). A cleanup handler that resolved "which adapter do I use" via
 * `installFs()` at CLEANUP time would therefore always see the real adapter,
 * even for a directory that was staged entirely inside a fake-adapter call —
 * performing real filesystem IO on a path that only ever existed in the
 * fake's in-memory store. `install-profiles.cts` avoids this by capturing
 * the adapter OBJECT `installFs()` returns at STAGING (registration) time,
 * keyed by path, in its own `STAGED_DIR_ADAPTERS` map, and replaying that
 * captured object — not the ambient `current` — at cleanup time. A real
 * install's dirs were staged with the real adapter object, so their cleanup
 * is byte-identical to before this fix.
 *
 * `withInstallFs` ALWAYS restores the previous adapter in a `finally`, even
 * on throw — a failed install (or a test that intentionally throws to prove
 * a guard) must never leak a fake adapter into whatever runs next in the
 * same process (e.g. the next `node:test` in a shared worker).
 *
 * ⚠️ PARTIAL-ADAPTER TRAP (#2875 defect fix — CLOSED, not merely documented):
 * `withInstallFs` used to merge the injected `partial` OVER the real adapter
 * (`{ ...REAL_ADAPTER, ...partial }`), so any method the partial did not
 * define silently resolved to REAL `node:fs`. An incomplete fake was not a
 * smaller fake adapter; for the methods it omitted, it WAS the real
 * filesystem — a genuine production hazard, not only a test-authoring
 * footgun: `user-artifact-staging.cts`'s `stageUserArtifacts` calls
 * `installFs().rmSync(entryDir)` unconditionally as its entryDir-clearing
 * step, and a `deps.fs` that omits `rmSync` (an easy oversight — nothing in
 * the type system catches a plain-JS test object missing a key at runtime)
 * silently deleted the real `<configDir>/.gsd-staging/<key>` on disk instead
 * of failing loudly or staying confined to the fake's own store.
 *
 * `withInstallFs` now builds a GUARDED adapter instead: every method the
 * partial does not define — except `realpathSync`, the one method this
 * module's own contract documents as intentionally degrading to real fs
 * (see its own doc comment below) — throws immediately IF CALLED, naming the
 * missing method, instead of silently delegating to real fs. This only
 * changes behavior for the injected-partial path (`withInstallFs(partial,
 * fn)` with a defined `partial`); the no-adapter-injected default (AC4)
 * still resolves to `REAL_ADAPTER` untouched, and any partial fake that
 * genuinely implements every method its code path touches — the documented,
 * intended usage — is byte-identical to before. A test asserting "no real IO
 * happened" against a partial fake can now rely on this guard directly
 * instead of having to hand-poison real `fs` methods itself (see
 * `tests/executed-plan.test.cjs`'s F2 test, which still poisons real `fs` as
 * defense-in-depth belt-and-suspenders, not because this guard is
 * insufficient on its own).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SECURITY NOTE (40-design.md rows 6/7, H1-H5)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This module carries NO policy. `hasExistingSymlinkBetween` and
 * `assertDestWithinConfigHome` keep their REFUSAL DECISIONS outside this
 * seam — only their probe calls (existsSync/lstatSync/realpathSync) are
 * routed through it. Injecting a fake adapter can only change what those
 * probes observe for paths that were never real to begin with; it cannot
 * flip the decision logic itself.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DELIBERATELY NOT ROUTED (see the call sites themselves for the full
 * reasoning — this is the index)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `findInstallSourceRoot` / `findAgentsSourceRoot`'s walk-up-from-__dirname
 * step (runtime-artifact-layout.cts) locates THIS PACKAGE'S OWN source tree
 * (`commands/gsd/`, `agents/`) — not the install destination — so it uses
 * `fs.statSync` directly, unrouted. A fake destination adapter's store
 * starts empty and is never seeded with real repo paths; routing this walk
 * through it would make every fake-adapter install throw
 * "could not locate commands/gsd", not gracefully stage nothing. See the
 * comment at each function's Step 2 for the full argument.
 *
 * RULE (40-design.md "Known limits"): this seam makes *destination* IO
 * fake-able; package-source IO (this section) stays real by design — the F2
 * test's poison list should be derived FROM that rule, not the reverse, or a
 * future "complete the poison list" edit that adds `statSync` will break a
 * correct `findInstallSourceRoot` for the wrong reason.
