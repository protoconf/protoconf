## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keep KV store panic stubs: Intentional interface satisfaction; panics signal future needs
- Token-based auth over mTLS: Simpler to implement and forward to scripts as env vars
- Proto-defined CLI configs: Consistency with protoconf's own philosophy; agent already does this
- Migrate jhump/protoreflect to dynamicpb: Deferred to v2 — large scope, touches compiler/starproto extensively

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 (Unit Test Coverage) depends on Phase 2 (os.Exit Refactoring) so tests can test real error paths — plan Phase 9 only after Phase 2 is complete
- Phase 10 (Integration Tests) depends on both Phase 6 (Auth) and Phase 9 (Unit Tests) — schedule last
