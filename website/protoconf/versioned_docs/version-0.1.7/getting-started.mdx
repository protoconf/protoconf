# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the installation of protoconf, creating a basic configuration, and running the protoconf compiler to generate the final configuration.

## Installation

protoconf can be installed via Homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install protoconf/tap/protoconf
```

For other platforms, download the latest release from the [protoconf GitHub repository](https://github.com/protoconf/protoconf) and add the binary to your `PATH`.

## Defining the Configuration Structure

First, you'll need to define your configuration structure using Protobuf. The Protobuf files should be stored under `./src/<projectname>/<version>/<filename>.proto`. For example:

```protobuf title=./src/myproject/v1/server_config.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package myproject.v1;

message ServerConfiguration {
  bool is_debug = 1;
  uint32 max_connections = 2;
  float max_payload_size_mb = 3;
  google.protobuf.Duration request_timeout = 4;
}
```

In this example, `ServerConfiguration` is the configuration structure for a server. It includes fields for debug mode (`is_debug`), maximum number of connections (`max_connections`), maximum payload size (`max_payload_size_mb`), and request timeout (`request_timeout`).

## Writing the Configuration Logic

Next, you'll write the configuration logic in a Starlark file, which should use the `.pconf` extension and be stored under `./src/`. For example:

```python title=./src/myproject/server_config.pconf
load("//myproject/v1/server_config.proto", "ServerConfiguration")
load("//google/protobuf/duration.proto", "Duration")

def main(ctx):
    return ServerConfiguration(
        is_debug=True,
        max_connections=1000,
        max_payload_size_mb=64.0,
        request_timeout=Duration(seconds=5),
    )
```

In this example, the `ServerConfiguration` message from the Protobuf file is loaded, and then a new `ServerConfiguration` object is created in the `main()` function.

## Running the protoconf Compiler

Finally, run the protoconf compiler to generate the final configuration:

```bash
protoconf compile .
```

The compiled configuration will be stored in a JSON file under `./materialized_configs/<projectname>/<filename>.materialized_JSON`. For example, `./materialized_configs/myproject/server_config.materialized_JSON`.

This JSON file contains the final, compiled configuration that your application can consume.

With this, you've created your first protoconf configuration! The next section will cover more advanced topics, such as configuration validation and how to consume configuration updates in different programming languages.
