## Implementing Config Manipulation Pipelining

In more advanced scenarios, you may want to implement a pipeline for config manipulation, where a series of transformations are applied to a config message in a specific order. This can be useful when you have complex configuration needs that require a series of operations to be performed on a configuration.

The following is an example of how you can implement config manipulation pipelining in protoconf:

```python title=./src/myproject/helpers.pinc
load("//myproject/v1/server_config.proto", "ServerConfiguration")

def Chain(msg, *hooks):
    queue = list(hooks)
    queue.append(lambda m, _: m)

    def run_next(c):
        next = queue.pop(0)
        return next(c, run_next)

    first = queue.pop(0)
    return first(msg, run_next)

def ServerConfigApi(*hooks):
    return Chain(ServerConfiguration(), *hooks)

def SetMaxConnections(num):
    def do(msg, next):
        msg.max_connections=num
        return next(msg)
    return do

api = struct(
    ServerConfigApi=ServerConfigApi,
    SetMaxConnections=SetMaxConnections,
)
```

```python title=./src/myproject/server_config.pconf
load("//myproject/helpers.pinc", "api")

def main():
    return api.ServerConfigApi(
        api.SetMaxConnections(1000)
    )
```

In this example, the `helpers.pinc` file defines a `Chain` function that accepts a configuration message and a series of hooks. Each hook is a function that accepts a configuration message and a "next" function, performs some operation on the message, and then calls the next function with the modified message.

The `ServerConfigApi` function creates a chain of hooks starting with a new `ServerConfiguration` message, and the `SetMaxConnections` function is a hook that sets the `max_connections` field of a `ServerConfiguration` message.

The `api` struct packages these functions together so they can be loaded into other files.

Then, in `server_config.pconf`, the `api` struct is loaded and used to create a `ServerConfiguration` with `max_connections` set to 1000.

This approach allows you to compose complex configurations in a clean, structured way, enhancing readability and maintainability.

This technique of chaining operations is sometimes referred to as "function chaining" or "pipeline processing", and is a common pattern in functional programming. It can be especially helpful when dealing with complex or multi-step transformations.
