/**
 * Pure phase-id parsing/matching helpers — normalize, token match,
 * milestone/phase-dir id parsing, phase-markdown regex builders.
 *
 * Extracted from core.cts (ADR-857 rollout phase 2a / issue #865).
 * The hand-written bodies are preserved byte-for-behaviour; only the module
 * boundary moved. The core.cjs re-export spine was retired in epic #1267;
 * callers import phase-id helpers from phase-id.cjs directly.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - ./pattern.cjs (escapeRegex — #3212 Phase 1 seam; this module is no
 *     longer the owner of pattern-escaping, only a consumer)
 *   - ./core-utils.cjs (generateSlugInternal — #3883/ADR-3473 §8.3: the
 *     canonical slug formula). core-utils.cjs also requires THIS module
 *     (comparePhaseNum, scopeToPhase), so a top-level require here would be
 *     circular and — per this codebase's compiled-.cjs convention of a
 *     single `module.exports = {...}` reassignment at the bottom of each
 *     file — a top-level circular require captures a stale, still-empty
 *     exports object forever (verified live: it throws
 *     "generateSlugInternal is not a function" when core-utils.cjs happens
 *     to load first). The require is deferred (lazy, inside each function
 *     body) instead, mirroring the same cycle-break already used by
 *     core-utils.cts's own getPhaseFileStats/plan-scan.cjs seam.

//                              separator, not a continuation heuristic

//
// DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from the M-NN dir-token path (pinned by the parity gate
// in tests/continuation-grammar-parity.test.cjs, which fails if these two rules
// drift for a reason nobody intended): the non-slug-adjacent positions stay
// WIDER than #2232's cap. Bracket admits 3+-digit milestone/phase/sub-phase

// same line for the same reason — core-utils/phase cap the paired PLAN component
// while the leading phase component stays unbounded (phase numbers ≥100 are
// legitimate). The trade-off this accepts is #2232's policy verbatim: a PLAN
// ≥100 is out of the token grammar.
//

// admits a letter-suffixed and unpadded leading token that the parser rejects):
// this is a READ-TOLERANCE source for the PR-2 readers, which must recognize a

// now one source.
//
// The milestone width mirrors the EMIT grammar rather than accepting any digit
// run: pad2() emits at least two digits, so two digits — or three-plus with no
// leading zero — is what toDir can produce. A bare `0` is NOT admitted: the
// padded `00` is the backlog sentinel's canonical identity and `\d{2}` already
// covers it, so nothing needs the unpadded spelling. (An earlier revision of
// this comment claimed the opposite; the constant below has always rejected it
// — #2867 review, Minor 2.) `[GSD.2] 05:` is therefore NOT a bracket id —

// the emit validator rejects, and a bare `0` that pad2 never produces. Every
// bracket-milestone recognizer now derives from this one constant — the section
// recognizers previously spelled `0*N` or `\d+` and accepted `[GSD.2]`, which
// SCOPED a milestone no phase heading could then resolve into, recreating the
// on-disk-count fallback this PR exists to remove.

 * Disk-side sentinel recognizer (#3639): is this on-disk PHASE DIRECTORY a

 *
 * The disk-side guards (C001 gap numbering, W007 orphan dirs) see raw
 * directory names and do not know the repo's naming convention — and neither
 * convention-blind route could recognize a bracket sentinel: `isSentinelPhaseId`
 * without the convention argument reads only the legacy leading int, while
 * `extractPhaseToken(dirName)` (convention-aware or not) strips the MILESTONE
 * and returns the bare phase token — bracket sentinel-ness lives in the
 * milestone portion (`GSD.999-07-icebox` is icebox because of the 999, not
 * the 07). This helper reads the milestone directly off the dir name.
 *
 * The bracket branch requires the FULL bracket dir shape — code prefix, dot,
 * milestone digits, hyphen, PHASE DIGITS — so a #1324 letter-prefixed real
 * dir with a LETTER slug (`P0.0-foundation`) never matches it (ADR-2121
 * indistinguishability, same gate as extractPhaseToken below). DISCLOSED
 * RESIDUAL (#3639 review): the #1324 family also has digit continuations
 * (`P0.0-1-foundation`, `P0.3-2` are real shapes per derivePhaseTokenSegments),
 * and `{code}.{0|999}-{digit}...` is string-indistinguishable from a bracket
 * sentinel dir — no convention-free discriminator exists (ADR-2121). Such a
 * dir reads as sentinel here, which at the disk-guard call sites suppresses
 * a warning (conservative for a linter) rather than deleting data. The
 * digit-continuation family with NON-sentinel first decimals (`P0.3-2`)
 * reads milestone 3 — ordinary — exactly as the convention-gated id
 * predicate does. Everything else falls to the legacy leading-int rule.

/**
 * #3511 (reworked — adversarial review found the membership rule wrong in
 * approach, not just detail): predicate for AGGREGATE phase-directory scans
 * (every matching file contributes, e.g.
 * uat-predicate/phase.cts/state.cts/uat.cts/audit.cts's `*-UAT.md` /
 * `*-VERIFICATION.md` scans) — answers "does fileName belong to THIS phase"
 * so a stray, cross-phase, or ad-hoc file (`04-VERIFICATION.md` sitting in
 * phase 03's directory) cannot contribute its status to phase 03. This is
 * deliberately NOT `resolveVerificationFile` (`src/verification.cts`,
 * #3357/#3492) — that resolver answers a SINGLE-PICK question ("which one
 * candidate is THE report") for a phase dir already known to hold one; this
 * answers a per-file membership question for a scan that must fold in EVERY
 * match. See "Reconciliation" below — the two do NOT fully agree.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL BUG: files are named by `normalizePhaseName`
 * (`cmdScaffold`, `src/commands.cts` — PADDED, project-code-STRIPPED), while
 * this predicate read the directory's OWN token via the literal, unpadded,
 * project-code-CARRYING `extractPhaseToken(phaseDirName)`. Two different
 * normalizations of the same phase number, so a literal
 * `startsWith(token + '-')` excluded a phase's own artifacts whenever they
 * disagreed: `CK-01-foundation` (token `CK-01`, file `01-VERIFICATION.md`),
 * `1-unpadded` (token `1`, file `01-VERIFICATION.md`), and the #2528
 * digit-leading-slug family `05-80-20-cleanup` / `10-24-7-autonomy` (token
 * over-absorbs past the digit run `cmdScaffold` actually writes: `05-80-20`
 * vs the real `05-UAT.md`).
 *
 * THE FIX: build the set of every phase-number READING this directory could
 * plausibly resolve to elsewhere in the module, then check fileName against
 * ALL of them — reusing the exact readings `matchPhaseDirs` /
 * `phaseNumberForMatch` (#2528, below) already carry for directory
 * RESOLUTION, so this membership check can never diverge from what "the
 * directory for phase N" means elsewhere in the module (no third
 * normalization — CLAUDE.md's Generative Fix Divergence class):
 *   1. the literal token (`extractPhaseToken(phaseDirName)` — still correct
 *      for the common case and for genuine decimal / letter-suffixed
 *      sub-phase dirs);
 *   2. the same token read off the project-code-STRIPPED name
 *      (`stripProjectCodePrefix` — the exact fallback `phaseTokenMatches`
 *      already applies, #612/#1324);
 *   3. the directory's own LEADING DIGIT RUN on the stripped name
 *      (`LEADING_DIGIT_RUN_RE` — the #2528 bare-integer-fallback reading,
 *      the one that actually matches what `cmdScaffold` writes for the
 *      digit-leading-slug family); and
 *   4. each of (1)-(3) additionally passed through `normalizePhaseName`,
 *      since files always carry the PADDED form and directories often do
 *      not (`1-unpadded` vs `01-...`).
 * A file belongs when it starts with any candidate + `-` OR any candidate +
 * `.`, compared case-insensitively (matching `phaseTokenMatches`' own rule —
 * review item 8: `03A-VERIFICATION.md` vs `03a-foo`). This is a PREFIX check,
 * not a full-token equality — `03-01-SUMMARY.md` (phase 03, plan 01) must
 * still match dir `03-foo` on candidate `03`, even though
 * `extractPhaseToken('03-01-SUMMARY.md')` would (wrongly, for this purpose)
 * read `03-01` as a mis-absorbed 2-digit continuation.
 *
 * DOTTED SUB-PHASE CONTINUATION: the dot arm of the check exists because this
 * module's own token grammar (`PHASE_NUMBER_TOKEN_SOURCE`) admits a dotted
 * sub-phase continuation (`(?:\.\d+)*`) alongside dash-continuations — a
 * sub-phase artifact `01.1-CONTEXT.md` is `01`'s own file, written into `01`'s
 * directory, not a stray from a different phase. A dash-only prefix check
 * excluded it (`01.1-` does not start with `01-`), which is over-exclusion:
 * the dangerous direction for an aggregate scan whose fail-safes above all
 * default to inclusion when membership is unclear. Widening dash-only to
 * dash-OR-dot only ever ADDS a match a candidate already earned; it cannot
 * newly admit a file whose leading digits differ from `candidate`, so it
 * cannot resolve a genuinely different phase's artifact (`02.1-...` still
 * fails every `01`-rooted candidate).
 *
 * BRACKET CONVENTION (review item 7): a letter-prefixed-decimal dir
 * (`P0.3-2-slug`) is string-INDISTINGUISHABLE from a bracket-dir token
 * (`extractPhaseToken` above, gated on `convention === 'bracket'`) without an
 * explicit convention signal — and this predicate is never given one: none
 * of its 9 call sites thread `convention`/config through today. Rather than
 * guess a reading it cannot know is active and risk excluding the phase's OWN
 * artifact (the exact defect class this rework exists to fix), this family
 * (`firstLetterPrefixed` dirs) falls into the same include-everything
 * fail-safe as the zero-segment case below — a documented, deliberate
 * widening (it also stops excluding a genuine stray from a DIFFERENT
 * letter-prefixed-decimal phase, narrowly) accepted in trade for never
 * dropping the phase's own report. Convention-aware scoping for this family
 * is deferred to whenever a call site actually threads `convention` through.
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE (#3511, unchanged): when dirName's own leading segment carries no
 * phase-number token at all (`derivePhaseTokenSegments` finds zero segments —
 * the same condition `extractPhaseToken` treats as "return dirName
 * unchanged"), no reliable token exists to scope against. Excluding on an
 * unreliable token would make an aggregate gate silently PERMISSIVE in the
 * wrong direction — dropping the phase's own real blockers — which is worse
 * than the cross-phase-contamination bug this predicate exists to fix.
 * Instead every file is treated as belonging to the phase (returns `true`
 * unconditionally), matching pre-fix (unscoped) behaviour for that directory.
 *
 * FIX 2 — bare `VERIFICATION.md` / `UAT.md` (no dash, no token of its own):
 * `derivePhaseTokenSegments(fileName)` also finds zero segments for these —
 * the file carries no phase number to compare against anything. Directory
 * containment is the only signal available for a token-less file, and it is
 * sufficient: every call site passes `fs.readdirSync` results for ONE
 * specific phase dir, so a token-less candidate already reaching this
 * predicate (past each call site's own verification/UAT suffix pre-filter)
 * is, by construction, that phase's own
 * listing. Returns `true` unconditionally, same as the dir-side fail-safe.
 *
 * RECONCILIATION WITH resolveVerificationFile (#3357/#3492/#3511) — the two
 * surfaces now AGREE. `resolveVerificationFile`'s fallback (`verification.cts`,
 * "Fallback" step in its own docblock) filters its dashed candidates through
 * THIS predicate — `isPhaseArtifact(f, phaseDirName)` — before picking
 * alphabetically-first, via a new `phaseDirName` option every call site
 * threads in (the same basename each already derives for `phaseToken`). So a
 * stray cross-phase file can no longer win the single-pick fallback either:
 * it is excluded there for the identical reason it is excluded from the
 * aggregate scans here — membership, not canonical shape. The fail-safes stay
 * aligned too: when this predicate cannot determine membership for a
 * directory (returns `true` unconditionally — see FAIL-SAFE above),
 * `resolveVerificationFile`'s filter is a no-op and its fallback degrades to
 * the original pre-#3357 "alphabetically first of ALL dashed candidates"
 * behavior, exactly as it always did for that directory shape.

/**
 * #3511: scope `fileNames` to the subset that passes

 * phase-directory scan routes through, so the membership rule has ONE owner.
 *
 * AN EMPTY RESULT IS A REAL ANSWER — deliberately, and this is the hard-won
 * part. An earlier revision of this helper carried an extra rule ("scoping
 * must never turn a non-empty set into an empty one": if the filter removed
 * every file, return the unfiltered input). It was added to rescue a
 * directory whose basename merely PARSES phase-shaped —
 * `gsd-651-broad-grep-a1b2`, an `mkdtemp`-style fixture name that
 * `extractPhaseToken` reads as project code `gsd` + phase `651` (the capture
 * regex is case-INSENSITIVE) — holding only `01-bg-VERIFICATION.md`, which
 * the filter then dropped, yielding an empty set indistinguishable from "no
 * report exists".
 *
 * That rescue was wrong, and no local rule can make it right: a directory
 * whose own name says phase 651 holding only a file that says phase 01 is
 * STRING-INDISTINGUISHABLE from `03-foo/` holding only `04-VERIFICATION.md`
 * — the exact cross-phase stray #3511 exists to exclude. Keeping the rule
 * meant a real phase directory holding only a MISFILED report would resolve
 * to it and publish another phase's `passed` as its own: the reported bug, in
 * its single most damaging form. `missing` is the correct answer when a
 * phase's own report is genuinely absent, and every caller already has a
 * `missing`/`null` branch for it.
 *
 * The over-exclusion that rule was reaching for is instead handled where it
 * is actually determinable, inside `isPhaseArtifact`: the zero-token dir
 * fail-safe, the `firstLetterPrefixed` bracket-ambiguity fail-safe, the
 * token-less-filename rule, and the multi-reading candidate set (literal /
 * project-code-stripped / leading-digit-run, each also padded AND de-padded)
 * that covers every normalization a phase directory and its files can
 * legitimately disagree on. A file excluded after all of those genuinely
 * names a different phase.
 *
 * SITE DISCIPLINE: every aggregate-scan call site (`uat.cts`,
 * `uat-predicate.cts`, `phase.cts`, `audit.cts`, `state.cts`,
 * `core-utils.cts`'s `getPhaseFileStats` — #3511 BLOCKER-2 — and
 * `init.cts`'s two phase-info-projection sites — #3511 BLOCKER-3, both of
 * which scope the raw listing once up front and reuse it for every bare
 * `.find()`/`.some()` artifact predicate: context/research/UAT/reviews/
 * patterns) and `resolveVerificationFile`'s single-pick fallback
 * (`verification.cts`) MUST route through this helper rather than calling
 * `isPhaseArtifact` in a filter position directly, so the rule cannot be
 * re-derived per site (CLAUDE.md's Generative Fix Divergence class).
 * `isPhaseArtifact` stays exported for single-item membership questions and

 * had already diverged; the selection itself must not.
 *
 * Two passes:
 *   1. PRIMARY — exact token match (`phaseTokenMatches`), unchanged behavior.
 *   2. BARE-INTEGER FALLBACK — only when the primary pass matched NOTHING and
 *      the query is a bare integer, re-filter by each directory's own LEADING
 *      digit run (zero-padded compare). This catches digit-leading slug shapes
 *      the tokenizer cannot disambiguate from genuine sub-phase segments
 *      (e.g. "05-80-20-cleanup", phase 5 named "80/20 Cleanup", whose token
 *      "05-80-20" is byte-identical in shape to a real deep-decomposition dir).
 *      The fallback can only turn a silent not-found into a resolution or into
 *      a surfaced ambiguity (callers keep their #2237 multi-match guards) —
 *      never override a primary match.
 *
 * SCOPE, precisely (#2528 re-review). Non-bare QUERIES ("46-6", "12A",
 * "PROJ-42") never enter the fallback, so nothing changes about how a
 * deep-decomposition or letter-suffix lookup is asked. What DOES change is the
 * DIRECTORY side: a bare query now reaches directories the tokenizer classified
 * as multi-segment, and a genuine sub-phase directory has exactly that shape.
 * So `5` against a lone `05-01-auth` resolves (phase_number "05", phase_name
 * "01-auth") where it previously found nothing.
 *
 * That widening is DELIBERATE and it is irreducible from directory names alone.
 * `05-01-auth` (sub-phase 5.1) and `30-12-factor-refactor` (phase 30 named
 * "12-Factor Refactor") are the same string shape — `NN-NN-<slug>` — and the
 * discriminator that would separate them, "is the second segment a valid decimal
 * sub-phase", accepts both (`5.1` and `30.12` are equally well-formed). Any rule
 * strong enough to exclude `05-01-auth` also excludes `30-12-factor-refactor`,
 * which is the defect #2528 exists to fix. The tie is therefore broken in favour
 * of resolving, and the consequence is bounded on the side that matters: when
 * BOTH readings have a directory (`05-01-auth` + `05-02-api`) the result is two
 * matches. `tests/phase-resolution-parity.test.cjs` pins both directions: the
 * lone-directory resolution and the two-directory refusal.
 *
 * WHAT IS SHARED IS SELECTION, NOT AMBIGUITY POLICY. This function is the one
 * owner of "which directories does this query name". What a caller does with
 * two of them stays the caller's own decision, and the callers split in two
 * tiers on purpose:
 *
 *   REFUSE on `matches.length > 1` — `searchPhaseInDir`, `cmdFindPhase`,
 *   `cmdPhasePlanIndex`, `cmdPhaseRemove`. These either act destructively or
 *   answer "which phase is this", so guessing is worse than reporting the
 *   candidates (#2237).
 *
 *   TAKE `matches[0]` — `cmdPhasesList`, `cmdInitManager`, `cmdRoadmapAnalyze`,
 *   `cmdVerifySchemaDrift`, `detectVerifyFailed`. Each read a directory to
 *   DECORATE a row they are already emitting; each used `.find()` before this
 *   PR, so first-match is their prior behavior preserved verbatim, and each is
 *   order-stable because the directory list is sorted and this function filters
 *   without reordering.
 *
 * The honest caveat on that second tier: the bare-number fallback makes
 * multi-match newly REACHABLE for inputs that previously found nothing, so those
 * five can now silently pick one of several candidates where they used to report
 * not-found. That is a widening of an existing first-match rule, not a new rule
 * — but it is a widening, and promoting any of them to refusal is a UX decision
 * about their own output, not a change to selection, so it does not belong here.
 *
 * `usedBareFallback` tells callers to derive the displayed phase number from
 * the directory's leading digit run instead of `extractPhaseToken` (whose
