// GSD Write Guard — PreToolUse hook
// Blocks a whole-file Write that catastrophically shrinks a curated .planning/
// artifact (ROADMAP.md, milestone roadmaps, STATE.md).
//
// Problem (#973, fix 3 of 3): a planner read a ~16-line window of ROADMAP.md
// and Write-overwrote the whole 292-line file with it — three milestones of
// committed history destroyed. Fixes 1 and 2 (PR #989) are instructions to a
// model: they lower the probability of a clobber but cannot prevent one, and
// they protect only the agents that were audited. This hook is enforced by
// code rather than by instruction: it compares the pending Write payload
// against the file on disk and hard-blocks a catastrophic shrink BEFORE it
// happens. An advisory will not do — #973 records an agent reading the
// advisory, classifying it as non-binding, and reasoning past it while
// holding a false model of what Write does.
//
// The guarantee is bounded, and the bound is worth stating where the code
// lives: this stops accidental and single-shot collapse, not a determined
// agent. The sentinel hatch below is a plain file, so an agent that would
// reason past an advisory can arm one with a single Bash call it is already
// permitted to make. What ships is the conversion of "ignore a sentence" into
// "take one deliberate, path-bound, single-use, auditable action" — a real
// improvement against the confused-agent threat #973 records, not a defense
// against an evader.
//
// Deliberately narrow trigger:
//   - Write only (Edit/MultiEdit are scoped by construction);
//   - the target already exists on disk;
//   - the target is a curated .planning/ artifact — the project ROADMAP.md,
//     milestone roadmaps (.planning/milestones/*-ROADMAP.md), and STATE.md.
//     NOT arbitrary markdown: free-prose docs get legitimately rewritten
//     wholesale, and a guard that fires on those trains override-fatigue
//     until nobody reads it.
//
// Threshold: block when the pending payload carries fewer than SHRINK_RATIO
// (40%) of the on-disk line count. The docs-update fix-loop's 90% bar is far
// too permissive for a curated artifact — the #973 incident was a ~94.5%
// collapse and clears a 90% bar only barely. The same ~40%/floor-40 tuning
// has run clean (no false positives) as a commit-time twin downstream.
//
// Floor: files under FLOOR_LINES are exempt, so a 10 → 2 line stub never
// trips the ratio check.
//
// Escape hatches — both named in the block message; a guard whose bypass is
// undocumented gets bypassed with the blunt instrument instead, with every
// other guard disabled at the same time:
//   - GSD_ALLOW_PLANNING_SHRINK=1 (env) — for a human running interactively,
//     where the variable can actually reach the hook's environment.
//   - .planning/.gsd-allow-shrink (single-use sentinel file) — for workflow
//     steps. A PreToolUse hook inherits the RUNTIME's environment, so a
//     per-step env prefix can never reach it (#2255 round 5 M1); the sentinel
//     is a transport that code consults, not prose an agent obeys. The step
//     writes the target's path into the sentinel; at the block point the
//     guard checks it is fresh (15 min) and names the pending target, then
//     CONSUMES it and allows that one write. Path-bound + single-use +
//     freshness is what keeps it from becoming a standing unlock left on disk.
//
// Known design limits (out of #2255's scope by review, disclosed here AND in
// the changeset + USER-GUIDE — round 9 required the user-facing docs to match):
//   - Stateless per-write: sequential shrinks (292→120→50) each clear the 40%
//     floor against CURRENT disk state, so cumulative erosion is invisible.
//   - Unconditionally case-insensitive matching (required on the
//     case-insensitive filesystems macOS/Windows default to): on
//     case-sensitive Linux a genuinely distinct '.planning/roadmap.md' is
//     also treated as curated. Narrow, accepted cost.
// (A third limit — a symlinked path into a curated file escaping the lexical
// match — was closed in round 9: the target is realpath-resolved before the
// curated match.)
//
// Triggers on: Write tool calls
// Action: BLOCK (decision: 'block', exit 2) on catastrophic shrink of a curated file
// No-op: other tools, new files, non-curated paths, sub-floor files, override set,
//        hook errors (silent fail)
