<augment_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-next` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
GSD smart entry — the state-aware front door. Detect what's going on in this project, then present a short menu of the right next actions and dispatch to one.

This is a launcher/router only. It never does the work itself. It reads project + workflow state via `gsd-tools smart-entry --json`, shows a situation-appropriate menu, and hands off to an existing GSD command.

Follow /Users/smintz/go/src/github.com/protoconf/protoconf/.augment/gsd-core/workflows/smart-entry.md. Detect the situation, present the menu, and dispatch exactly one command. Then stop.
