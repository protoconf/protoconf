# Agent Contracts

Completion markers and handoff schemas for all GSD agents. Workflows use these markers to detect agent completion and route accordingly.

This doc describes what IS, not what should be. Casing inconsistencies are documented as they appear in agent source files.

## Marker Rules

1. **ALL-CAPS markers** (e.g., `## PLANNING COMPLETE`) are the standard convention
2. **Title-case markers in gsd-verifier and gsd-integration-checker are intentional as-is, not bugs — a recorded decision.** Their rows are `artifact+query`/`structured-return` (completion is detected through the row's `Kind` route), and the markers are carried as `(unconsumed: Marker Rule 2 recorded decision …)` annotations: an auditable exemption, never deleted and never silently passed. `## Synthesis Complete` in gsd-doc-synthesizer was NOT covered by this rule; #3565 deleted it deliberately because it case-collides with gsd-research-synthesizer's `## SYNTHESIS COMPLETE` and nothing matched it
3. **Non-standard markers** (e.g., `## PARTIAL`, `## ESCALATE`) in audit agents indicate partial results requiring orchestrator judgment
4. **`Kind` describes how a caller actually detects an agent's completion, and is exactly one of:**
   - `sentinel-match` -- a workflow, command, or another agent detects completion by an exact-case string match against a declared marker
   - `artifact+query` -- the agent writes a file (report, JSON, generated doc) and the caller reads or queries that artifact instead of matching any marker text
   - `structured-return` -- the agent has no way to write files (no `Write` tool) or simply doesn't; it returns parseable sections, a table, or JSON inline, and the caller reads that return text directly
5. Markers must appear as H2 headings (`## `) at the start of a line in the agent's final output
6. The `Consumed by` / `Kind` columns are machine-enforced by `check:contract-drift` (`scripts/check-contract-drift.cjs`), which cross-checks this table against what each `agents/*.md` file actually emits in-fence and what every `gsd-core/workflows/**`, `commands/**`, and `agents/**` file actually consumes. Update this table whenever an agent's return contract changes -- a stale row is a violation the check will report, not something to leave for later.
7. A marker entry annotated `(unconsumed: <reason>)` is emitted deliberately but matched by no workflow, command, or agent — a display/presentation format no orchestrator branch consumes (the `## ROADMAP DRAFT` header was the canonical case until #3797 folded its content into `## ROADMAP CREATED`). The check still verifies the marker is declared **and** emitted, and still counts it for case-collision purposes; only the consumer requirement is waived. Use it for display formats, never to silence a real orphan.

| `<tasks>` | Yes | Ordered task list with type, files, action, verify, acceptance_criteria |
| `<verification>` | Yes | Overall verification steps |
| `<success_criteria>` | Yes | Measurable completion criteria |

### Executor -> Verifier (via SUMMARY.md)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Frontmatter | Yes | phase, plan, subsystem, tags, key-files, metrics |
| Commits table | Yes | Per-task commit hashes and descriptions |
| Deviations section | Yes | Auto-fixed issues or "None" |
| Self-Check | Yes | PASSED or FAILED with details |

## Workflow Regex Patterns

Workflows match these markers to detect agent completion:

**plan-phase.md matches:**
- `## RESEARCH COMPLETE` / `## RESEARCH BLOCKED` (researcher output)
- `## PLANNING COMPLETE` (planner output)
- `## CHECKPOINT REACHED` (planner/executor pause)
- `## VERIFICATION PASSED` / `## ISSUES FOUND` (plan-checker output)

**execute-phase.md matches:**
- `## PHASE COMPLETE` (all plans in phase done)
- `## Self-Check: FAILED` (summary self-check)

> **NOTE:** `## PLAN COMPLETE` is the gsd-executor's completion marker but execute-phase.md does not regex-match it. Instead, it detects executor completion via spot-checks (SUMMARY.md existence, git commit state). This is intentional behavior, not a mismatch.
