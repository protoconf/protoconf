**Step 4.5: Plan-checker loop (only when `$VALIDATE_MODE`, called from planner-wave.md)**

Runs once per DAG layer, for every item in that layer that produced a
PLAN.md this round (row 17 of the design's behavior table). Per item, max 2
iterations — identical cap to `/gsd:quick --validate`'s own loop
(`gsd-core/workflows/quick/steps/plan-checker-loop.md`), just run per item
instead of once for the whole batch.

For each item in the current layer:

<instructions>
Make targeted updates to address checker issues.

`required_property` + evidence + severity BIND. `fix_hint` is ONE non-binding example route: a
smaller or different mechanism reaching the same property resolves it — say which. Re-check
capability guidance (CLAUDE.md, project skills) and the constraints this plan already encodes
BEFORE editing; if a hint would contradict one, or the property is unreachable without breaking
one, return `## REVISION_CONFLICT` with the conflict and the alternatives rather than applying or
working around it. Full contract: `gsd-core/references/planner-revision.md`.

Do NOT replan from scratch unless issues are fundamental. Keep `depends_on`/`files_modified`
frontmatter current with the revised plan. Return what changed.

**If the planner returns `## REVISION_CONFLICT`:** a conflict is not resolvable by re-running the
same loop, so it must not consume this item's retry budget. Do NOT increment `iteration_count`
and do NOT re-spawn the checker yet. Present the conflict table and its alternatives to the user
and ask which to take: adopt a named alternative / override the named constraint and apply the
hint / amend the constraint itself. Every option resolves the conflict. Accepting the plan with
the blocker still open is NOT offered here — the blocking `required_property` still fails, and
that choice belongs to the iteration-exhaustion escalation below, unchanged.

A quick-batch item has no REVIEWS.md and no phase, so `workflow.plan_review_convergence` has
nothing to arbitrate over here; the user is the only route. Re-spawn the planner with the chosen
resolution, then re-evaluate its return from the top of this handler — do not fall through to the
checker spawn below. A second conflict is still a conflict, not a revised plan.

**Bounded:** a conflict naming the SAME `required_property` twice in a row, or the THIRD conflict
return of this loop whatever property it names, is a stall — alternating property names would
otherwise never trip the repeat rule and the path would be unbounded. Route it to the same
iteration-exhaustion escalation below rather than re-spawning further.

**Otherwise (the planner returns a revised plan, not `## REVISION_CONFLICT`):** spawn the checker
again for this item, increment `iteration_count`.

**At iteration >= 2 with issues remaining (or a stalled conflict, above):** do NOT block the whole batch.
Display the remaining issues for this item and offer: 1) force-proceed with
this item as-is, 2) mark this item `failed` (`failure_reason`: "plan-checker
issues unresolved after 2 iterations") and continue with the rest of the
batch — one item's unresolved plan-check does not block unrelated items (row
33).

Once every item in the layer has passed (or been force-proceeded/failed),
return control to `planner-wave.md` step 8 (persist depends_on/files_modified,
recompute waves).
