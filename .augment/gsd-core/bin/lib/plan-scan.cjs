/**
 * Strict canonical-naming predicate over a `scanPhasePlans` `planFiles`/

 * or nested `plans/PLAN-<NN>....md`/`plans/<x>-PLAN-<NN>....md` — WITHOUT
 * `isRootPlanFile`'s loose delimited-PLAN fallback.
 *
 * The `plans/` prefix check is load-bearing, not cosmetic: `isNestedPlanFile`
 * matches ANY basename containing `-PLAN-<digits>...md` with no anchor
 * requiring an actual `plans/` directory — that shape is exactly the #2893
 * reporter's non-canonical example, `01-PLAN-01-foundation.md`. Applying
 * `isNestedPlanFile` directly to a bare root-level name would therefore
 * misclassify that exact offender as canonical. Only entries scanPhasePlans
 * itself produced with the `plans/` prefix (i.e. read from the real nested
 * subdirectory) are eligible for the nested check.
 *
 * #2893/#3183: `isRootPlanFile`'s loose fallback is deliberately permissive
 * for live-plan COUNTING (a lowercase `plan.md` still counts toward
 * completion — see plan-count-single-owner.test.cjs's pinned case-sensitivity
 * asymmetry). But the #2893 "non-canonical filename" diagnostic (phase.cts's
 * `describeNonCanonicalPlans`, used by find-phase/phase-plan-index/phases
 * list --type plans) exists specifically to CATCH a plan-shaped file that
 * does NOT match the canonical contract and warn instead of silently
 * scheduling it. Feeding that diagnostic (and the `plans`/`files` lists those
 * commands return) the loose `allPlanFiles`/`planFiles` set defeats the
 * diagnostic entirely, since the loose fallback already recognizes the
 * non-canonical file as "matched". This predicate is the STRICT filter those
 * three call sites intersect against so the diagnostic (and what counts as a
 * schedulable plan for those commands specifically) stays canonical-only,
 * while scanPhasePlans's own planCount/summaryCount/completed stay on the
 * loose, permissive rule.
