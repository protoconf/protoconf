/**
 * User Artifact Staging Module — #2875 (epic #2866 Phase 6), governed by
 * ADR-3574 and `.gsd/phase/feat-2875-materialization-primitives/40-design.md`
 * Part 1.
 *
 * Durable, on-disk staging for user-owned artifacts (`USER_OWNED_ARTIFACTS`,
 * `install-engine.cts`) across the preserve → wipe → restore window that
 * `preserveUserArtifacts`/`restoreUserArtifacts` previously held only in an
 * in-memory `Map` (#1874-F19). A process death between preserve and restore —
 * Ctrl-C, OOM, a converter throw mid-copy — silently discarded the map,
 * losing the user's file forever. Staging to disk closes that window;
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` closes the OTHER half of the fix: a staged
 * copy nothing ever reads back is bytes-safe but user-visibly lost — the
 * #1879-F15 inert-fix failure mode 40-design.md's "inertness trap" section
 * names explicitly. See that doc for the full rationale.
 *
 * Synchronous only, matching install-fs-adapter.cts's documented contract —
 * every fs call in this module routes through `installFs()`.
 *
 * Staging layout, all under a caller-supplied `stagingRoot` (by convention
 * `<configDir>/.gsd-staging/user-artifacts/` — a sibling of every wipe
 * target this phase's call sites wipe, so staging survives all of them,
 * while still resolving inside `configDir`):
 *
 *   <stagingRoot>/<sha256(destDir)-16>-<sha256(runId)-8>/record.json  — the commit point
 *   <stagingRoot>/<sha256(destDir)-16>-<sha256(runId)-8>/files/<name> — copied, symlink-safe
 *
 * The sha256-of-destDir component (not a raw path) keeps the entry-dir name
 * filesystem-safe; the sha256-of-runId component (`opts.runId`, default
 * `String(process.pid)`) discriminates concurrent RUNS targeting the same
 * destDir (module doc "Concurrency" below) while still making repeat calls
 * from the SAME run (the same process, the default case) reuse/overwrite the
 * same entry rather than accumulating orphans (test-matrix A6) — hashing
 * `runId` rather than using it raw keeps the same filesystem-safety/bounded-
 * length guarantee the destDir hash already provides, regardless of what a
 * caller passes.
 *
 * `record.json` (`{ destDir, names, timestamp }`) is written AFTER every
 * file copy lands, never before — a half-written staging directory (a crash
 * during the copy loop) has no record, and `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts`
 * ignores it (test-matrix B4/A7). The record's PRESENCE is what "staged"
 * means; this module never infers completeness from directory contents
 * alone.
 *
 * Confinement: this module carries the SAME "no policy, reuse the existing
 * decision" discipline install-fs-adapter.cts documents for
 * `hasExistingSymlinkBetween` / `assertDestWithinConfigHome` — it never
 * reimplements either. Every path this module writes, and every path
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` reads OUT of an on-disk record before
 * writing to it (attacker-influenceable input the moment an install runs on
 * a shared machine — test-matrix E2), is re-resolved through the SAME
 * `assertDestWithinConfigHome` (runtime-artifact-install-plan.cts) every
 * other write on this call tree already uses, never a bespoke check.
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` ADDITIONALLY re-applies `hasExistingSymlinkBetween`
 * (install-engine.cts) — the SAME guard `_copyStaged`/
 * `migrateLegacyDevPreferencesToSkill` apply to their own writes — against
 * the record's `destDir` once it has cleared `assertDestWithinConfigHome`
 * (#2875 defect fix, test-matrix E2 strengthened): lexical confinement alone
 * does not detect a symlinked ANCESTOR directory (e.g. `<configDir>/linkdir
 * -> <outside>`, a record naming `<configDir>/linkdir/sub/USER-PROFILE.md`)
 * — `path.resolve` string math has no concept of what a path component
 * actually IS on disk. `hasExistingSymlinkBetween` is required lazily
 * (inside the function body, not at module top) via `require('./install-
 * engine.cjs')` specifically to avoid a load-time circular require:
 * install-engine.cts imports this module statically at its own top, so a
 * static top-level import here would capture install-engine's exports
 * object BEFORE its own `export =` assignment runs, permanently binding to
 * an empty object (the classic `module.exports = {...}` circular-require
 * footgun) — a lazy, call-time `require` instead resolves against the fully
 * populated module, exactly matching the existing lazy-require precedent
 * `runtime-artifact-install-plan.cts` already uses for the same reason. This
 * module does not accept a `configDir` parameter to `stageUserArtifacts` (it
 * cannot confine `stagingRoot` itself against a configHome — callers remain
 * responsible for that; the same call-site pattern `_copyStaged`/
 * `migrateLegacyDevPreferencesToSkill` already use for
 * `hasExistingSymlinkBetween`, including the symlinked-staging-root refusal,
 * test-matrix E4 — see install-engine.cts's and bin/install.js's call sites).
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts`, however, DOES take `configDir` explicitly —
 * deriving it from `stagingRoot`'s own path shape would rest the E2
 * confinement guarantee on a naming convention rather than an explicit
 * caller-supplied value, which is fragile in exactly the direction E2 exists
 * to guard against.
 *
 * Never-overwrite (C2) and destination-symlink refusal: both
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` and `restoreStagedUserArtifacts` probe the
 * destination with `lstatSync` (never `existsSync`) before writing (#2875
 * defect fix). `existsSync` FOLLOWS symlinks and reports `false` for a
 * DANGLING one — a symlink whose target does not exist — so an
 * `existsSync`-based "is something already there" check is blind to exactly
 * a dangling symlink planted at the destination; `copyFileSync`/
 * `symlinkSync` (via `copyPreservingSymlink`) then follow that link and
 * create the attacker-chosen target outside `configDir`. `lstatSync` never
 * follows a symlink and succeeds for a dangling one, so it correctly reports
 * "something is here" (a symlink, whatever its target) rather than "nothing
 * is here". Every path name staged, restored, or recovered is REQUIRED to be
 * a flat name — no path separator of either platform's flavor (`/` or `\`),
 * matching every real caller's actual usage (a single flat filename like
 * `'dev-preferences.md'`) and the `E3/E5` traversal/NUL-byte rejection this
 * module already performs; a name containing a separator is rejected the
 * same way (test-matrix rewritten E-series).
 *
 * Symlink safety: staged files are copied via installer-migrations.cts's
 * `copyPreservingSymlink` (routed through `installFs()` by this same phase),
 * which never dereferences a symlink — a managed path replaced by a link to
 * (e.g.) `~/.ssh/id_rsa` cannot have the referent's bytes copied into the
 * staging tree, or back out of it on restore/recovery (test-matrix A4). This
 * is the SOURCE side; consumers that read a staged copy's CONTENT back
 * (rather than re-copying it byte-for-byte via `copyPreservingSymlink`) must
 * separately check `lstatSync(...).isSymbolicLink()` before calling
 * `readFileSync` on it, or `readFileSync` will happily follow the staged
 * symlink and read the referent's bytes — see install-engine.cts's
 * `_runLegacyInstallMigrations` call site for the guarded pattern.
 *
 * Failure posture: staging (`stageUserArtifacts`) throws on any real IO
 * failure — an existing file that cannot be copied, or the staging directory
 * itself cannot be created. This is deliberate (test-matrix D4, a
 * correctness row, not an error-handling row): a caller MUST let this
 * propagate and abort BEFORE wiping the source directory, or the wipe
 * proceeds having staged nothing, which is worse than no staging at all.
 * `restoreStagedUserArtifacts`/`discardStagedUserArtifacts`/
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` degrade instead: a missing staged file, a
 * missing `stagingRoot`, or a malformed record are all treated as "nothing
 * to do", never a throw — the durability property this module exists for
 * would be self-defeating if RECOVERY could itself crash an install.
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts`'s "never throws" contract is enforced with
 * a per-FILE try/catch around every copy (a failure recovering one name is
 * reported and skipped, the rest of the batch still proceeds) wrapped in a
 * per-ENTRY try/catch around the whole batch (a failure this module did not
 * anticipate — e.g. `symlinkSync` throwing `EPERM` for an unprivileged
 * Windows user, or a staged `files/<name>` that is unexpectedly a directory
 * — is reported and the loop moves to the NEXT staging entry rather than
 * propagating out of the function entirely). A batch that cannot be
 * recovered is never swept — it is left in place for a future run or manual
 * inspection, matching this module's existing "malformed record left alone"
 * precedent (C6).
 *
 * CONCURRENCY (#2875 defect fix, test-matrix row F1 — previously documented
 * as an open limitation requiring a cross-process lock; that reasoning was
 * revisited and found unnecessarily strong): two RUNS (processes) racing the
 * same `destDir` no longer share an entry directory. The staging key is
 * `sha256(destDir)` COMBINED with `sha256(runId)` (`opts.runId`, default
 * `String(process.pid)`) — the OS guarantees PID uniqueness among
 * SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING processes, so two concurrently-live installs always
 * key to different entry directories, and `stageUserArtifacts`'s
 * entryDir-clearing step / `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts`'s end-of-batch
 * `rmSync` can therefore never destroy a DIFFERENT live run's in-flight or
 * just-committed batch — the destructive clear is safe by construction, no
 * lock needed. A crashed run's orphaned entry is not lost either: it is
 * swept the ordinary way, by a LATER run's `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts`
 * pass (module doc "Failure posture" / C1-C4) — recovery iterates every
 * entry under `stagingRoot` regardless of which run's key produced it, and
 * the C2 never-overwrite guard means a stale orphan from an earlier crashed
 * run can never clobber a newer, already-restored file.
 *
 * OWNER-LIVENESS GUARD (#2875 defect fix, closes the F1 residual above — a
 * SECOND run's recovery pass executing WHILE a first, still-live run is
 * between `stageUserArtifacts`'s commit and its own
 * `restoreStagedUserArtifacts`/`discardStagedUserArtifacts` call is not an
 * exotic interleaving: `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` runs as the FIRST
 * statement of both `install()` and `uninstall()`, so it is exactly what
 * happens whenever a second install starts while a first is still inside its
 * wipe): `record.json` now carries `runId` RAW (unhashed — `stagingKeyFor`
 * still only ever sees the hash) alongside `timestamp`, and
 * `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` treats an entry as belonging to a STILL-LIVE
 * run — leaving it COMPLETELY untouched, neither recovered nor swept, never
 * even attempting `assertDestWithinConfigHome` against it — when ALL of:
 * (1) `runId` parses as a valid positive-integer pid (`parseOwnerPid` —
 * `"0"` and negative values are excluded because POSIX treats those as a
 * process-GROUP signal, never a single pid); (2) `process.kill(pid, 0)`
 * does not report `ESRCH` (`isProcessAlive` — cross-platform pid-existence
 * probe that sends no actual signal; any outcome OTHER than "provably dead"
 * is treated as "alive", including `EPERM`); (3) the record's `timestamp` is
 * within `OWNER_LIVENESS_GRACE_MS` (5 minutes — a generous multiple of this
 * codebase's own 60s npm-subprocess timeout convention, chosen because the
 * failure direction is asymmetric: skipping a genuine orphan for up to 5
 * minutes merely delays recovery, the bytes stay on disk, whereas sweeping a
 * live run's entry destroys data outright) of `clock.now()` — the pid-reuse
 * guard: an OS pid recycled onto an unrelated, currently-alive later process
 * cannot mask a genuine orphan past this window regardless of what
 * `process.kill` reports. `recoverOrphanedUserArtifacts` now accepts the
 * SAME `{clock}` seam `stageUserArtifacts` already does (default the real
 * `Date`) — never reads the wall clock directly. Every one of these checks
 * degrades toward NOT protecting (i.e. toward the pre-this-fix, always-
 * eligible-for-recovery behavior) rather than toward protecting forever: a
 * missing/non-numeric `runId` (an old record, or a hand-edited one) is never
 * treated as live, and an unparsable `timestamp` never grants indefinite
 * protection — see `parseOwnerPid`/`ownerStillLive`'s own doc comments.
 *
 * This closes the F1 residual as previously documented: recovery no longer
 * has any interleaving with a live peer run that can destroy that peer's
 * data. What remains, and is inherent to any liveness probe rather than a
 * gap in this specific check: a false "alive" reading (an unrelated process
 * reusing the crashed run's exact pid, itself started within the same
 * `OWNER_LIVENESS_GRACE_MS` window) delays that one orphan's recovery by up
 * to 5 minutes — never data loss, only a bounded delay, and exactly the
 * direction this guard is biased toward.
 *
 * Explicitly out of scope (40-design.md "Explicitly out of scope"): fsync
 * durability (crash-safe against process death only, not power loss);
 * routing the raw-`fs` uninstall wipe at call site 2
 * (`_runLegacyUninstallCleanup`) — only the staging call itself routes
 * through `installFs()` there, the surrounding wipe stays raw `fs` by
 * design (Phase 5 deliberately left the uninstall tree unrouted).

 * to be a directory, an `mkdirSync`/`rmSync` failure) is reported via
 * `skipped` and the function moves on — to the next name, then to the next
 * staging entry — rather than propagating (#2875 defect fix: this contract
 * was previously false; `mkdirSync`/`stagedCopy`/the final `rmSync` were all
 * unguarded, so a single bad entry could throw out of this function
 * entirely, and because the throw happened before that entry was ever
 * cleaned up, it also permanently bricked every FUTURE install/uninstall —
 * this function is called as the very first step of both).
 *
 * Re-confinement (E2): the record's `destDir` is data, not policy — this
 * function never trusts it directly. `configDir` is a REQUIRED, EXPLICIT
 * parameter (not derived from `stagingRoot`'s own path shape — resting E2's
 * confinement guarantee on a path-naming convention would let a caller that
 * passes a differently-shaped `stagingRoot` silently get the wrong
 * confinement root, in either direction, which is exactly what E2 exists to
 * prevent). The recorded `destDir` is re-resolved through the SAME
 * `assertDestWithinConfigHome` every other write on this call tree uses
 * against the CALLER-SUPPLIED `configDir`, THEN through the SAME
 * `hasExistingSymlinkBetween` `_copyStaged`/`migrateLegacyDevPreferencesToSkill`
 * apply to their own writes (#2875 defect fix — `assertDestWithinConfigHome`
 * alone is pure lexical `path.resolve` string math and cannot see a
 * symlinked ANCESTOR directory between `configDir` and the recorded
 * `destDir`). A record naming a `destDir` outside it, lexically or via a
 * symlinked ancestor, is refused (`skipped`), never written.
 *
 * Callers MUST invoke this before the ordinary preserve step, from a
 * PRODUCTION entry point (test-matrix C7 — anti-inertness). Calling this
 * function directly and never wiring it into a real install path is exactly
 * the #1879-F15 inert-fix failure mode this module exists to avoid; see
 * bin/install.js's `install()`/`uninstall()` for the wiring.
