/**
 * install-scope.cts — Install Scope Module (#2870, ADR-2866, governed by
 * ADR-2866, Phase 0 PR #3265).
 *
 * `resolveScope()` turns a bare `'global' | 'local'` string — previously
 * re-derived at 12 `isGlobal ? 'global' : 'local'` sites in `bin/install.js`
 * plus several downstream consumers — into ONE resolved value produced by
 * ONE module. See `.gsd/phase/feat-2870-install-scope-module/40-design.md`
 * for the full behavior table and rationale; the summary that matters for
 * future readers is captured in the comments below.
 *
 * This module OWNS the `InstallScope` type name. It was previously declared
 * (as a private, non-exported `TypeAlias`) inside
 * `runtime-artifact-install-plan.cts`; that module now imports it from here
 * instead of re-declaring it, so the codebase has one spelling of "install
 * scope" instead of a fifth one appearing alongside the three that already
 * existed (`'local' | 'global'` in the layout module, `'global' | 'project'`
 * in capability-lifecycle, and the single literal `'project'` in
 * capability-consent).
 *
 * ── Compose, never modify, resolveConfigHomeFromDescriptor ─────────────────
 * `resolveConfigHomeFromDescriptor` (`runtime-homes.cts`) is rated CRITICAL
 * blast radius: 60 dependents across 13 files and 2 process flows. Adding a
 * `scope` parameter to it — the "obvious" refactor — would touch all 60 for
 * no reason this module needs: it already resolves the GLOBAL config home
 * correctly today. So this module calls it as-is for the global scope and
 * derives the LOCAL scope's config dir independently (see
 * `resolveScopeConfigHome` below) — genuine composition, not a rename. Every
 * one of those 60 call sites stays byte-identical.
 *
 * ── Why `settingsFile: null` is correct, not a bug ──────────────────────────
 * Only `claude` declares `hostBehaviors.settingsFileByScope` in the
 * capability registry; the other 18 registered runtimes do not have a
 * per-scope settings file at all. Returning `null` for them is honest —
 * substituting `'settings.json'` (or any other Claude-shaped default) would
 * invent a fact for every non-Claude runtime that asked. Callers that
 * legitimately want a Claude-specific fallback (there is exactly one today,
 * `bin/install.js:550`) apply it themselves; this module does not.
