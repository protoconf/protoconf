# gsd-hook-version: 1.13.0
# gsd-node-runner.sh — GSD portable node resolver (#3662).
#
# Managed JS hook commands under --portable-hooks route through this script:
#
#   bash "<hooks>/gsd-node-runner.sh" "<baked-node-path>" "<script.js>" [args...]
#
# so a config root shared across environments (mounted ~/.claude, shared
# containers) resolves node at hook-fire time instead of depending on the
# absolute path of whichever environment ran the installer. Candidates, in
# order — the first executable one wins:
#
#   1. the first argument — the install-time node path, tried FIRST and by
#      absolute path so the #2979/#3002/#3017/#3022 minimal-PATH guarantee
#      holds (GUI launches with a stripped PATH still resolve where the
#      baked path exists);
#   2. `command -v node`, accepted only when it yields an absolute path;
#   3. the well-known stable layouts: $HOME-derived mise/volta shims, the
#      Homebrew prefixes, /usr/local/bin/node, /usr/bin/node.
#
# No bare `node` lookup is ever depended on: a candidate is used only after
# an explicit executable check, and when nothing resolves this script fails
# visibly (stderr diagnostic + exit 127) rather than emitting a half-resolved
# invocation.
#
# The candidate list below is a SUPERSET of the inline chain token emitted by
# buildNodeRunnerChainToken (src/runtime-hooks-surface.cts, #3662) — keep the
# two lists consistent.
#
# Diagnostic escape: GSD_NODE_RUNNER_NO_FALLBACKS=1 disables candidates 2-3
# (first-argument-only resolution) — used by the test suite and useful to
# pin down which node a given environment picks.
