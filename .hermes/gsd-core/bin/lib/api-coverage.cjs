 * API-Coverage detector + matrix validator (#1562).
 *
 * The enforcement half of "Full API Coverage by Default — Opt Out, Never Opt In."
 * When a phase integrates an external API/service/SDK, the planner must produce a
 * coverage matrix (COVERAGE.md) enumerating the API's capability surface; every
 * non-integrated capability is an explicit, reasoned opt-out. The seal-time gate
 * (capabilities/ai-integration, verify:pre) consumes this module to (a) detect
 * whether a phase integrates an external API and (b) validate the produced matrix.
 *
 * Design notes (rubber-duck'd):
 *  - DETERMINISTIC + TYPED IR. Both the "does this phase integrate an external
 *    API?" decision and the "is this matrix complete?" decision are pure
 *    functions returning typed IR, not LLM judgments — so the low-false-positive
 *    guarantee (acceptance criterion #4) and the completeness guarantee
 *    (acceptance #2) are testable. Mirrors assumption-delta.cts (#1561).
 *  - COMPOUND SIGNAL for low false positives. A bare word like "api" appears in
 *    countless non-integration phases ("the public API of UserController"). The
 *    detector requires an INTEGRATION VERB and an EXTERNAL-API NOUN in the SAME
 *    CLAUSE (#2365 — same-line co-occurrence across unrelated clauses over-fired;
 *    the clause boundary, not a word-gap cap, is the relationship test), or an
 *    explicit "<Service> API/SDK" phrase naming a real service. Single weak
 *    tokens do not fire. This is the issue's "low false-positive trigger" made
 *    mechanical.
 *  - CODE AND PATHS ARE NOT PROSE. Fenced code blocks and inline code spans are
 *    stripped first (markdown-sectionizer seam), and path-shaped tokens
 *    (`src/app/api/...`, URLs) are masked, so a trigger term inside code or a
 *    first-party route path does not fire (#2365).
 *  - NO-INTEGRATION DECLARATION (#2365 acceptance #5). A COVERAGE.md consisting
 *    of `No external API integration: <reason>` is a valid, reasoned way for a
 *    phase to state that no external surface exists — the alternative to
 *    fabricating a matrix row when the detector is overruled by a human.
 *  - THE DETECTOR IS A FALLBACK. The primary path is the plan:pre contribution
 *    prompting COVERAGE.md creation. The detector runs only when COVERAGE.md is
 *    ABSENT, to catch the "nobody decided" case (acceptance #1). Its precision
 *    therefore matters but is not the only line of defense.
 *  - MATRIX FORMAT. The matrix is a markdown table (human-editable, diff-friendly)
 *    with a header row `| capability | decision | reason |` and one row per
 *    capability. decision ∈ {INTEGRATE, OPT-OUT}. An OPT-OUT row MUST carry a
 *    non-empty reason. A fenced ```coverage JSON block is also accepted for
 *    machine-generated matrices. This dual shape is bijective (parse/render
 *    round-trip) and covered by a fast-check property test.
 *  - ADDITIVE-ONLY VOCABULARY (Hyrum's Law). Once shipped, the verb/noun sets
 *    are depended-upon interfaces; they only grow. Tunable via the `terms`
 *    parameter so teams can widen them without forking.
 *
 * Public API:
 *   detectApiIntegration(text, terms?) -> { detected, signals, terms }
 *   parseCoverageMatrix(text) -> { rows, errors, format }
 *   validateCoverageMatrix(text) -> { valid, errors, counts }
 *   renderCoverageMatrix(rows) -> string
 *   DEFAULT_API_COVERAGE_TERMS
 *
 * CLI (ADR-3889 Phase 3, #3907):
 *   echo "$SCOPE" | node gsd-core/bin/lib/api-coverage.cjs [--json]
 *     exit 0 = integration detected, 1 = none (real input, examined, no signal),
 *     NO_INPUT (registry, src/cli-exit.cts) = stdin empty/whitespace-only,
 *     UNAVAILABLE (registry) = stdin read failed
 *     --json additionally prints the typed IR on stdout (unchanged for 0/1);
 *     NO_INPUT/UNAVAILABLE print {skipped:true, reason:"no_input"|"stdin_error"}
