Apply response_language to all user-facing prose — narration between tool calls, status updates, progress notes, and findings included; preserve code, paths, and identifiers.

# --batch mode — grouped question batches

> **Lazy-loaded overlay.** Read this file from `workflows/discuss-phase.md`
> when `--batch` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`. Combinable with default,
> `--all`, `--chain`, `--text`, `--analyze`.

## Argument parsing

Parse optional `--batch` from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Accept `--batch`, `--batch=N`, or `--batch N`
- Default to **4 questions per batch** when no number is provided
- Clamp explicit sizes to **2–5** so a batch stays answerable
- If `--batch` is absent, keep the existing one-question-at-a-time flow
  (default mode).

## Effect on discuss_areas

`--batch` mode: ask **2–5 numbered questions in one plain-text turn** per
area, instead of the default 4 single-question AskUserQuestion turns.

- Group closely related questions for the current area into a single
  message
- Keep each question concrete and answerable in one reply
- When options are helpful, include short inline choices per question
  rather than a separate AskUserQuestion for every item
- After the user replies, reflect back the captured decisions, note any
  unanswered items, and ask only the minimum follow-up needed before
  moving on
- Preserve adaptiveness between batches: use the full set of answers to
  decide the next batch or whether the area is sufficiently clear

## Philosophy

Stay adaptive, but let the user choose the pacing.
- Default mode: 4 single-question turns, then check whether to continue
- `--batch` mode: 1 grouped turn with 2–5 numbered questions, then check
  whether to continue

Each answer set should reveal the next question or next batch.
